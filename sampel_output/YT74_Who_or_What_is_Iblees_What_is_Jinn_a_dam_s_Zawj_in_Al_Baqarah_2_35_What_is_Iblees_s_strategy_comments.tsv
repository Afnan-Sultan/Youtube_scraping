Camil AAA	2021-12-06T20:10:13Z	if iblees was a jinn and command was for the angels to prostrate then why would have he prostrated?

Sam Smith	2021-12-06T01:47:06Z	Sorry I'm asking questions while listening and reading comments. Is Jannah then not a location or afterlife where we go after death?
Ibrahim Abdelaziz	2021-12-05T21:15:21Z	This is basically how Muhammad Asad (Allah be pleased with him) understood the Quran. His translation is very unique and unorthodox.

nadia rana	2021-12-04T04:46:18Z	Assalamualaikum wa rahmatallahi wa barakah, It Was painful to me when people would ask about jinns in a derogatory way to muslims beleifs , now it has become clear
Humayun Hamid	2021-12-03T00:38:38Z	As salam brother. Please, can you explain verse(7-189). JAK.
Altavian	2021-12-02T19:03:24Z	time 1:53 Dr Hany, i love your enthusiam and I am Learning everyday from you but I need to correct you brother also on one point: Jinn, you say that they are not separate creatures but in us. Conceptually this doesn't sound too wrong since it is our thinking that attracts them but my friend it is wrong. Jinn are real beings that often inhabit humans and run in the blood, just as the prophet said in a hadith, peace upon him. I know because I have dealt with them now for 22 years. They take snake forms and even dragon forms. You will have to trust I am honest and good muslim and I tell you the truth. Do not reject the injeel imho entirely, and you will learn that Jesus peace upon him, removed many jinns and even talked to jinns in people--you know in the quaran the jinn are also conversing with themselves about the new guidance and some became muslim--you are a great teacher, but please learn from us muslims who pratice islam in the world and must deal with these creatures daily, salaam
Abdi Karim	2021-12-01T23:13:11Z	Man!! Dr. Hany, I wonder how much time you put in. I wouldn't accumulate all these in M year.
Darnell Smith	2021-11-30T20:29:06Z	Why are 2 Jinns named in the Quran, Iblis and Ifrit in surah 27
The World is a Stage	2021-11-30T05:16:31Z	I agree to a point in regard to essentially making Bukhari and Sahih Muslim etc, as some sacred books with no flaws (which is humanely impossible to think there is no flaws in these books - hence after all there made/“memorized” by humans) but to generalize all hadith under this blanket of falsehood is nonsensical - for instance muttawatir hadiths came to us in the same way the Quran did - hence passed down and memorized by many many people - like do you pray 5 times a day, how do you pray etc.? which are mostly from not just “sahih” but Muttawatir hadiths After all, I like your theory and you use some good points but much of it is STILL conjecture at the end of the day - likes you maybe 1000% correct but you also may be misguided on a fee points because none of us can understand Arabic as those over a thousand years ago
Moyassar Meshhal	2021-11-30T01:46:23Z	"Subhan Allah! All of this nonsense only convinces those who do not know the Arabic language, no need to mention the other Islamic sciences. At the beginning, I thought that there is something worth to be discussed here, but after watching the entire video I realized that your countless number of mistakes actually came from imposing your own thoughts on Quran interpretation! In fact, I can not call what you have said here is a wrong interpretation/translation! It is a real corruption and Altering the meaning of Quran. I'll give my brothers and sisters here only a few examples just to think (because it needs tens of pages to respond to all the claims, which is obviously not possible here) : 1. He translated the word عن in the verse ""ففسق عن أمر ربه"" as in accordance with (or because of) and he claimed that it agrees with what sheikh 3udaimah said in the book ""Dirassaat"". Where on earth did you find any scholar translate a preposition (حرف الجر) by itself without a context?! By the way, I urge you all my brothers and sister, if you know Arabic, to look at the reference that he mentioned and see how he misused the work of Sheikh 3udaimah (My Allah give mercy on him). You will never find any of his claims there! In fact, Sheikh 3udaimah mentioned many meanings of the preposition ""عن"" depending on the context. And when you reflect on all of those meanings you will realize that ""Dirassaat"" does not support his claims by any mean. One more fun fact is that Sheikh 3udaimah actually built his entire work ""Dirassaat"" on the sayings of the scholars ""علماء"" that Dr. Hany claims that they were deceived by there own Iblees. Lol! 2. In the translation of the verse 1 of surah 4 (النساء), he imposed the word ""archetypes"" in his translation ""... and from their archetypes ..."" which is not their! The verse says ""منهما"" which means ""... from them ..."". He showed that as it is there, while it is actually his own insertion! 3. He claims that name/word ""Adam"" refers to prophet Mohamed (PBUH) without providing any proper evidence, except his own delusions! And a final question to you: Why all the accusations that you accused scholars, tabe3en, mofasreen ...etc do not apply to you instead of them?!"
Uni dhe Haruni	2021-11-29T21:13:46Z	As always; the most correct interpretation is that which is the most rational. I always had the view that Iblis is a faculty of the human psyche. It's very encouraging to see more evidence from the Qur'an regarding this view.
Nad Khan	2021-11-29T02:03:19Z	Devil Iblis Satan Lucifer the same thing. God Ellohim Ellah Allah Heavenly Father all the same principles
Azhar Aziz	2021-11-27T08:33:57Z	Allah commanded, but also has given iblees the freewill to follow or not to follow, thus the persecution for the arrogance of iblees. It was NOT the command to not follow.
NS Jugbhery	2021-11-26T20:16:22Z	Points to Ponder: 4:1 (Nafsin Wahidatin) single helix DNA, it gets into pair (2:34, 2:35) (Zawj, zawjatun) double helix DNA also referred as noble pair in Quran, from which all living creations and Humankind (Adam) are made from. Iblees are in DNA code as Zawj, Dr. Hany's descriptions explaining Bashar, inns/Inssan, Iblees, Muttaqun and Abrar similitude of genetical evolutions of human consciousness.
M Chibwana Abdullah	2021-11-26T18:56:49Z	As salaam alaikum Dr Can you explain about these verses وإذ صرفنا إليك نفر من الجن And وأنا من الصالحون ومنا دون ذلك سورة جن And وَيَوْمَ يَحْشُرُهُمْ جَمِيعًا يَا مَعْشَرَ الْجِنِّ قَدِ اسْتَكْثَرْتُمْ مِنَ الْإِنْسِ وَقَالَ أَوْلِيَاؤُهُمْ مِنَ الْإِنْسِ رَبَّنَا اسْتَمْتَعَ بَعْضُنَا بِبَعْضٍ وَبَلَغْنَا أَجَلَنَا الَّذِي أَجَّلْتَ لَنَا قَالَ النَّارُ مَثْوَاكُمْ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا إِلَّا مَا شَاءَ اللَّهُ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ حَكِيمٌ عَلِيمٌ are they not indicating that jinns are separate creature?
Mak Job	2021-11-25T22:46:31Z	Doctor Hany why dont you write a translation of the Holy Qur'an?
kamran mahmood	2021-11-25T09:10:59Z	Brother please can you tell about Allahuma what shall we pray in droodeibrahimi
Samama Fahim	2021-11-24T20:25:16Z	"Surely Satan is not something abstract. And he will be punished on the day of judgement as the Koran says: (Quran 14:22) After the matter has been finally decided Satan will say: ""Surely whatever Allah promised you was true; as for me, I went back on the promise I made to you.30 I had no power over you except that I called you to my way and you responded to me.31 So, do not blame me but blame yourselves. Here, neither I can come to your RESCUE, NOR CAN YOU COME TO MINE. I disavow your former act of associating me in the past with Allah.32 A grievous chastisement inevitably lies ahead for such wrong-doers."""

Paket Wisata Samalona Kodingareng Makassar	2021-11-24T07:34:09Z	Dr Hany, Would you please give us a more relevant meaning of surah 6 ( Al An'am ) verses 9. I believe something ( may be ) hidden in it . Thank you so much.
7Earths	2021-11-24T02:19:31Z	Are 'theatrical conversations' with Iblees, only your opinion? Or does the Qur'an prove it to be so with internal evidence?
K B	2021-11-23T13:29:34Z	Salamoun alaykoum Dr Hany, I was wondering, if Iblees is part of us, so why he asks God to reprieve him from yawm al deen until the day they are resurected? Surah 38.79 but also in surah 15. I mean Iblees is supposedly to be the bad part of us, so after death and between yawm al deen and day of resurection this bad part shall disappear? Why does he need an extension of Time?
Manuel Cardinali	2021-11-23T08:40:58Z	where are these tafasir coming from? This goes against the speech of the Prophet ﷺ and the Ijma' of the muslims
Shuaib Samad Ali	2021-11-23T07:19:32Z	Dr Hany, So, does all this confirms that the Iblees has no FREEWILL???

Semra Calik	2021-11-18T14:41:34Z	Selam Dr, I don t understand that we must me grateful (Allah forgive me) but it is so strange that Allah allows iblees to harm us and than He gives us the Quran and warns us against him. And the hole purpose of oud life is to fight against iblees… l Find it very descouraging and very “useless” … please can l get an answer 🙏🙏🙏
Semra Calik	2021-11-18T14:27:38Z	Selam, “communicate with Allah properly” what does that mean in a very specific way? 🙏

Semra Calik	2021-11-18T09:53:33Z	If you say : nothing happens without permission of Allah, this implicates that Allah gives permission for rapes, murders… “permission “ is this the right word/ thinking🙏

AR	2021-11-18T04:03:13Z	Assalamualikum, i was watching the Ya' juj Ma'juj before this. You were saying Muhammad s.a.w revealed the truth to the Jews about their own scriptures, and asked them to spread it to their own community. But in this video you're saying all the previous scriptures is invalid after the Al-Quran was revealed. So those Jews were misguided still after it was revealed by Muhammad s.a.w on how to use thier own scriptures? I hope you can clarfiy. Thanks.
Rizwan Safdar	2021-11-18T02:49:59Z	Shame on you Dr. (i.e. Deviated Rooh) Iblees!!! May Allah ( SWT) open your 👀 🥺 and grant you true wisdom 🙏
ISKANDAR KHAN TM	2021-11-17T13:53:31Z	Iblis is an integral part of the human psyche. Its akin to the Nafs/Ego Its like a wild horse but possible to tame If Iblis = Nafs/Ego then Qarin = Companion makes sense. Iblis = Qarin Iblis is Ego/Nafs/Self/companion/Qarin that is integral in every human psyche including the body, mind, heart,soul,spirit that needs to be controlled and tamed.
Mohamedsaid Amazigh	2021-11-17T07:32:09Z	Question: verse 55:15. He created the jinn from a smokeless fire... could you translate please. dear dr Hany, it is been a while since i watched this segment. I can not recall you discussing this. It kept me awake this night. I will watch the whole segment again soon insallah. Looking forward to your lectures on salat.
ggs shaikh	2021-11-17T05:11:57Z	how you will explain ayat 30:21وَمِن ءايٰتِهِ أَن خَلَقَ لَكُم مِن أَنفُسِكُم أَزوٰجًا لِتَسكُنوا إِلَيها وَجَعَلَ بَينَكُم مَوَدَّةً وَرَحمَةً إِنَّ فى ذٰلِكَ لَـٔايٰتٍ لِقَومٍ يَتَفَكَّرونَ
abrahamfofana	2021-11-16T19:17:34Z	Is the lecturer insinuating that Allah gives Ibliss the task to mislead mankind??? That’s what I’getting from him.
abrahamfofana	2021-11-16T19:13:01Z	I find the lecturer problematic in many level. Be aware of whom you listen to. Some truth and some misleading comments and over explanation b distorting the truth. The Quran is simple to understand.
Sahel Ahmed	2021-11-16T13:07:08Z	Sorry to say I find it very irritating to the whole of your methodology.I am confused why not all other world famous schoolers not talking anything about it.You are giving so much credit to IBLIS while Allah said he is our clear enemy.By the way I remember one of your video You said This is not arobic word at all.Allah said in sura yusuf That I send down this quran in arobic language so that you may undrestand better.However you said there is no dream what so ever.Allah knows best.My point is This is to much Fitnah My brother.Your logic is not fitting.Therefore I dont know you maybe the one making confused people then you will divided muslim into diffrent part. Zajakallah I have finished watching your video.And I will not watch again InsaAllah.
Maalim Hussein Hussein Abdi	2021-11-14T22:42:27Z	Thanks Dr but what surprises me is All the angels were told to prostrate Adam so according to ur explanation Iblis is not suppose to bcoz he is not an angel.

Selma Lamour Love	2021-11-13T21:07:28Z	How do you explain the verse in the Quran where it says “..and “they”see you from where you can’t see them” referring to jinn and shayateen. Also, I highly recommend you do research on psychedelics and how people who have used them had identical visions of entities. Intelligent entities that exist in other dimensions or worlds. Allah is The Lord of the Worlds..all worlds and dimensions and he gave us a sneak peak in the Quran about them..
Zero Celsius	2021-11-13T06:43:51Z	#1...Allah subhana wa ta ala orders us to read the earlier scriptures. Those scriptures have already told you who IBLEES/SATAN is. That said...JINN is a person (Human): Quran Surah 6 (Al-An-am) Ayah 130…They had the same HUMAN opportunities to see and obey the prophets; and they have SOULS Surah 72 (Al-jinn) ayah 6...PERSONS among JINN…not GHOSTS Surah 18 (Al-Kahf) ayats 50 & 51...JINN has human offspring Surah 41 (Fussilat) ayah 25...built nations Surah Al-Isra (Ch. 17) ayah 64…On horses and foot and sharing THEIR wealth & CHILDREN Surah Al-A'raf (Ch. 7) ayah 179…they have EYES, EARS & HEARTS
Muhibur Rahman	2021-11-13T05:12:42Z	Very informative ! However my question is why didn't Allah Subhanataala just killed Iblis right there and then when he didn't obey him? Why is he so important to Allah ?

Can you briefly explain this verse please which I am confused about: O mankind, fear your Lord, who created you from one soul and created from it its mate and dispersed from both of them many men and women (Qur'an 4:1) Is that as the traditionalists say the God created one man and woman and then they had children who committed incest and that's how humanity grew?
Super Mario 4	2021-11-08T13:17:12Z	While I commend the team for a great work done, I will like to ask the following; 1.So if the tafaasir we are familiar with are full of fables,what has Azhar university opinion versus yours? 2.In suura jin,who were the group that listen to the kuran,humans? 3.In the same suura,who are been pelted with flames.

EM	2021-11-06T18:01:44Z	"Maybe this video is too much for me to take in, so please be patient, and no personal attacks. When we talk about relearning the Quran, we are talking about relearning and redefining the meaning of words. If we lookup the meaning of words such as 'shajarah', we get different meaning (than what's shown in video). Lookup the meaning of the word 'Zaujuk', you'll get different meaning (compared to what's shown in video). How do we know which one is the correct one ? And, if we are redefining the meaning of words, are we really learning the Quran, or are we trying to keep religion relevant in the times when it is being forgotten ? @ 2:18:40 ""I really appreciate your patience and perseverance"" I don't have enough words to thank you for this insight.

Zil Q. Jaigirdar	2021-11-04T05:39:36Z	Salamun Alaikum, Just want to clarify one aspect, does the concept of Ijmaa' ( togetherness 7:18) convey similar meaning for Jumua 62:9? Is not the Yawmul Jumua a concept of Baina Aidihim- the previous people? If so, rush to Salat (concept to be clarified later) will be against the gathering and togetherness. I understand, I may be wrong or trying to go little ahead, however, I am trying to clarify to understand the concept better. As I am listening again and again and crisscrossing all similar words and Ayats, I am curios and trying to grasp as best as I can. If it's a too early call, give me some hints please, so that I can relate and understand. Am I thinking correct? Jazakallah. -Zil Qaosain
Straight line	2021-11-03T15:06:41Z	This is a very big and dangerous dawah you are giving, Allah made Islam easy to understand and not ambiguous, but if I was to entertain your point of view I'd basically have to reject every hadiths I know and also bring innovation ( bida). Innovation because when I translate the Quran in English, french, and another language, there's no unambiguous statement from the Quran which support your view. Allahu Allam
Ian Saeed	2021-11-02T02:03:42Z	Again, kindly expect the subtitling to as many different languages as possible the each of your video is enabled so that more and more muslims around the world can benefit from your explanation. Thank you.
Khalid Yassine	2021-10-31T17:37:40Z	Original But.... Interesting views about primary concepts in Quran. I have a question though : If Jinn has nothing to do with beings, how can we undertsand excerpts from : - Sourate al Jinn (nafaroun mina al jinn)? - Arrahmane (Ya ma'chara al insi wal jinni) ?

Stone Gold	2021-10-31T12:27:56Z	nice explanation but still not correct ,how can you explain surah rehman?How you explain these aya? وَخَلَقَ ٱلْجَآنَّ مِن مَّارِجٍۢ مِّن نَّارٍۢ سَنَفْرُغُ لَكُمْ أَيُّهَا الثَّقَلانِ لَمۡ یَطۡمِثۡہُنَّ اِنۡسٌ قَبۡلَہُمۡ وَ لَا جَآنٌّ and the question is how come only you understand the quran this way? also what about these aya about hawaa فَوَسْوَسَ لَهُمَا الشَّيْطَانُ لِيُبْدِيَ لَهُمَا مَا وُورِيَ عَنْهُمَا مِنْ سَوْآتِهِمَا وَقَالَ مَا نَهَاكُمَارَبُّكُمَا عَنْ هَٰذِهِ الشَّجَرَةِ إِلَّا -أَنْ تَكُونَا مَلَكَيْنِ أَوْ تَكُونَا مِنَ الْخَالِدِينَ فَدَلَّاهُمَا بِغُرُورٍ ۚ فَلَمَّا ذَاقَا الشَّجَرَة َ بَدَتْ لَهُمَا سَوْآتُهُمَا وَطَفِقَا يَخْصِفَانِ عَلَيْهِمَا مِنْ وَرَقِ الْجَنَّةِ ۖ وَنَادَاهُمَا رَبُّهُمَا أَلَمْ أَنْهَكُمَا عَنْ تِلْكُمَا الشَّجَرَةِ وَأَقُلْ لَكُمَا إِنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ لَكُمَاعَدُوٌّ مُبِينٌ
Sultan Kulbassov	2021-10-30T20:18:27Z	Question: If Prophet Muhammad never would add details to the Quran how can we accept that he himself said that he is the one who lighted the fire??????
EmeraldDiamond3	2021-10-29T23:00:43Z	So essentially anyone who said they saw another creation (jinn) is lying or crazy? Everyone ? And all the legit imam who specialize in that area are liars and cheaters??? They are all lying. That’s a reach my brother.
Adam Ifrene	2021-10-28T12:55:57Z	Al Salamu Alaikum, 2:00:02 Here when you talk about the verse in aya in Surah Waqiah, I believe you fail to mention the context in which the word سموم was mentioned. In the preceding ayat Allah describes heaven for the faithful and in the following ayat Allah is clearly describing hell as a fate for the wrongdoers. This is as clear as the sun so I wonder why and how you could bring this verse in totally out of context ??
Sultan Kulbassov	2021-10-27T22:26:10Z	35:42 Question 1: how come it can be understood as skies and earth whereas it is not samawaat but it is samaawaat? Question 2: What about those who reject? They don't praise God?

T Seward	2021-10-24T21:28:57Z	Who agrees with you? This is something only you understand no one else ever has for over 1400 years?
Khaled El Nazer	2021-10-24T14:02:26Z	Actually Angel in Arabic is Malak (ملاك). If you go to the root word in old Arabic it comes from the word Uluk أٌلٌك meaning message and hence Ma'alak (مألك) means messenger which was later changed to Malak (ملاك). The point here is that Angel or Malak is not a species but rather a job description (messenger) so there is no conflict between Iblees being a Jinn and a messenger (Angel) except in Judeo-Christian theology because the root meaning of the word Angel is lost. Hopefully you will also define the difference between Iblees (a real persona) and Shaytaan or Satan who is not a person or species but rather a behavior very much like criminal is a behavior not a person.
Ali Mirzamani	2021-10-24T09:30:49Z	I wish you would have talked about the difference between iblees and shaytan.
Khalid J.Yusuf	2021-10-23T17:01:52Z	Great interpretations lands in heart and mind clearly . God be with you .
Musabber Islam	2021-10-22T05:30:32Z	I think although he was very detail in terms of counterpart and clear but after that he was moving other direction.First of all Jinn is real and it’s Unseen And Allah clear it in 2:30 in Quran when Angels are debating regarding the justification of create another and refer to the consequences of earlier creation.Also 14:55 Allah subhanAllah confirm that He Created Jinn so its separate species.
manifestasisanubari	2021-10-21T13:06:00Z	Interesting theory but jinn as not a separate creature seems contradicting the jinns in sura Al-Anbiya' where Solomon has dominions over humankind and jinn, also the entirety of sura Al-Jinn himself where they (jinn) themselves talked about how they used to look up on the skies above for knowing the future, but now they can't. So I guess, I'm not agreeing with you but maybe you have an answer for this. Can't wait to hear if there is any
exhale inhale	2021-10-21T12:52:52Z	Hello Dr, Why was Iblees warned with Adam to avoid been zaalimeens? “Zawjuka” . Is being a zalimeen not part of Iblees’s character/attributes?
Be Humble	2021-10-19T09:25:47Z	Salaam, Please take all the versets related to Jinns, sorcery,black magic and read it in context. Jinns are separated being. Just like God say He will show us His signs within ourselves and upon horizon until it become clear that it (Quran)is the truth. You are based on your own interpretation of the versets I'm not sure you pay attention to the signs upon the horizon,if you never experienced Jinns issues you won't understand Jinns world,you won't believe Jinns are separated being and this is part of Jinn deception, manipulation. Please keep praying and doing your research,you may also consider traveling to other places if you never experienced Jinns where you are living, Africa or China will be some of the country I suggested you,Glory to God people like us who know nothing about Arabic languages we are guided by God through signs, witness, personal experiences, therefore those who seek to confuse and deceive people can't deceive us, Glory to God Almighty.
championkila x	2021-10-18T22:37:02Z	What about the jinn that listened to the Quran and became belivers , what about the jinn who sat at great heights but can no longer due to a bolt of fire , what about the jinn that eat from bones refleshed ?
Allan H	2021-10-18T16:30:55Z	I think you are working with Iblees to misguide people. You mix truth with falsehood very well I must say, but In Sha Allah not too many will fall for your deception. Jinn are clearly another created species. The first half of the video seemed logical and nothing not already known. you are very arrogant to assume that others haven't thought as you have on some deep issues. But then denying that Jinn are not a separate created species exposed you
exhale inhale	2021-10-18T10:55:11Z	Hello Dr Hany. Thanks so much for sharing your Aelm. Each time I want to know more. My questions are without prejudice, but for curiosity and getting clearance. 1. If iblees is not to adhere to every command cos he was in accordance with amr... Yet, he was among those who denied/ covered the truth. These are conflicting. Pls further explain with analogy. 2. What was his disposition and where do we get that from the Quran Dr Hany?
Dynamic Traders	2021-10-17T10:25:17Z	2:13:16 Sir, thanks you are making it too easy and beautiful to follow Quran and Sunnah mashAllah loving it.
Dynamic Traders	2021-10-17T10:00:14Z	Imam Ghazali R.a clearly defined this concept in his book mujarbate Imam ghazali. Everyone who is born is born with 5 things. 1. Jism 2. 2 angels 3. Hamzad 4.

Andy A	2021-10-14T20:28:14Z	Dr Hany, I am a Quranic Scholar, I reject Biographies/HADITH/MAMBO JUMBO, This is my gift to you and whom ever reads this, you Keep saying ALLAH THIS ALLAH THAT WHILE SPEAKING ENGLISH , OR IBLIS, OR Shitan or Jahanem,people don't know what they mean, those are Arabic words that confuse the none Arabic spoken individuals, is'nt bad enough that they think and teach in their schools that ALLAH IS THE DEVIL he not GOD, or Allah IS SOME GUY THAT Muslims WARSHIP, We are helping them with the notion that there is Allah other than the true God we warship. Just stop and think, the Muslim greeting in Arabic Asslamu Alikum is nothing but HELLO, GREETINGS, HI THERE!!! THAT'S what SALAM means. Muslims translated it into English gave it a totally BAZAAR translation, Because SALAM means Hello, SILM means PEACE, so, in order for may peace be upon you to be a correct English translation by Muslims, the Arabic greeting must be and should be AS SILM ALIKUM. I just wished this nation wakes up and pays attention to the damage and miss representations of Islam. ALSO, why is it so important using Arabic greetings when you're speaking different languages, I know people are proud to be Muslims, I certainly Iam, BUT, still mixing and miss representing words and meanings is not Islamic. God tells us to be kind and gentle.
Raheel Khan	2021-10-13T13:20:22Z	I do not agree of your explanation that iblees was not among the angels, Quran language is arabi mubeen so please do not pull out ambiguous meaning, if it's said to Angels to prostate before Adam & all obeyed except iblees, it clearly means he was ordered too but he denied, God addressed to angels only if he wasn't among them then what's the point to question??
bhq9767	2021-10-13T10:14:57Z	Do you plan to do Tafseer for the whole surah Jinn?

If they weren't seperate creatures how could they be swarming the prophet pbuh and then returning to their people, and how do jinn then, reach the lowest heaven? How can you explain the fact that soothsayers can sometimes 'tell' the future except through Jinn? What is black magic then? What about the Jinn that were working for Solomon?

diarfitri	2021-10-12T12:45:16Z	wait..... what?
Nomad The Madlad	2021-10-11T00:43:57Z	Interesting perspective which explains a ton of things cause I also was thinking how god would have an angel who would disobey him or even betray him? Or the later story where even though he was kicked out he manages to enter it again through peacock? How god wouldn't see that coming? And then although I didn't have the full picture but philosophically it would only make sense if iblis was something that god himself tasked him to be the opponent of human but then the in the usual story where he also will burn in hell doesn't make sense cause he is just doing what he was told to do, and it's intresting that by concept human is like a clay, it's strength depends on what it was made or given with through time like a clay with ingredients of like respect is defrent than a clay with ingredients of hatred but both of them at the beginning were clays ready to be molded and when it dries you can't give it new things nor take them away just like when human gets old, by the way I don't know how it's not used in Arabic but in farsi سُموم is the plural of سَم which is poison,so سُموم becomes poisons and these words entered to farsi through Arabic. Man so they even copy pasted this one too huh? How many other lies...
mo osman	2021-10-10T16:42:43Z	Ok. He is now confusing us all . I am no Arab but read the entire Quran Can he explain 1: where God said he created man and jinn only to worship him 2: How did nabi Suleiman use and command them and explicitly named one of them ifrit, the strongest, In the Quran If Jinn are not other creationwith superhuman abilities as you claim sheikh please explain those verses In the Quran.

Personally I pray the traditional way, I do my wudu as described in Surah Al Ma’ida. While praying, I always have the feeling that something is out of the ordinary when there’s another mention than Allah. This got me thinking if the prayer that we preform is the correct way or not.

S M Ishtiak Hossain	2021-10-08T22:09:42Z	1st Question. Why would God order the Angels and Iblees to prostrate to Adam in submission except Him? Isn’t it Shirk? Aren’t we suppose to prostrate in submission to only the God? The answer lies in the translation of the word “sujud”. The word sujud does not mean physical prostrate. It means acceptance. Allah ordered everyone to accept Adam as God’s most intellegent creation. In Baqara 2:31, God taught Adam everything. And then his Intellegence was tested. Nobody knew what God asked, but Adam knew it as God taught him. So God ordered everyone to “accept” him as the most intellectual genius. Masjid is not place of prostration, it is Level of Acceptance. Masjid al haram is the basic level of acceptance when you believe in God without seeing him. Masjid al Aqsa is the furthest/highest level of acceptance when you meet God and become 100% confirm about God’s exsistence. In 17:1, Sahih International: Exalted is He who took His Servant by night from al-Masjid al-haram to al-Masjid al- Aqsa, whose surroundings We have blessed, to show him of Our signs. Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Seeing. Then in verse 17:2, its talking about giving book to Moses as a guidance. 17:2 Sahih International: And We gave Moses the Scripture and made it a guidance for the Children of Israel that you not take other than Me as Disposer of affairs. Thus verse 17:1 is not talking about prophet Mohammad, rather it talks about prophet Moses, who was given the scripture only when his level of Acceptance is upgraded from basic (masjid al haram) to the Highest (masjid al aqsa) by showing him God’s sign and by meeting him personally. This passage also proves that Sujud and Masjid are not physical prostration or place of prostration, rather its acceptance and the level of acceptance respectively.

Youths Of Islam	2021-10-06T10:08:29Z	"*Hello Dr. What do you think of this verse. Allah says clearly about the existence of jinns as a separate physical creation with their own society and culture. Is this also wrong translated ???* وَإِذْ صَرَفْنَآ إِلَيْكَ نَفَرًا مِّنَ ٱلْجِنِّ يَسْتَمِعُونَ ٱلْقُرْءَانَ فَلَمَّا* حَضَرُوهُ قَالُوٓا۟ أَنصِتُوا۟ۖ فَلَمَّا قُضِىَ وَلَّوْا۟ إِلَىٰ قَوْمِهِم مُّنذِرِينَ And [mention, O Muhammad], when We directed to you a few of the jinn, listening to the Quran. And when they attended it, they said, ""Listen attentively."" And when it was concluded, they went back to their people as warners. Al-Ahqaf 46:29 قَالُوا۟ يَٰقَوْمَنَآ إِنَّا سَمِعْنَا كِتَٰبًا أُنزِلَ مِنۢ بَعْدِ مُوسَىٰ مُصَدِّقًا لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ يَهْدِىٓ إِلَى ٱلْحَقِّ وَإِلَىٰ طَرِيقٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ They said, ""O our people, indeed we have heard a [recited] Book revealed after Moses confirming what was before it which guides to the truth and to a straight path. Al-Ahqaf 46:30*"
sidjoo sin	2021-10-06T07:01:04Z	"Sheikh, blessed message ""la IIaha illa Allah"" and wicked message ""la ilaha"" - not the same. We cannot take part of sentence before ""illa"" and make conclusion out of it. ""all angels except Iblis"" could mean that Iblis is not belongs to angels, than we can say ""All Muslims except George Bush"" - it"
EBC SECURITY	2021-10-05T16:49:42Z	This channels f-history way of interpretation clearly does not make any sense since Iblees is going to heaven according to this channel.... because Iblees is simply submitting to Allah's way in Islam. If Iblees was submitting, then why would Allah accuse him of arrogance? How can a being submitting to Allah be our enemy? Allah says all good is from him and all evil is from us, so if Iblees is submitting, then this channels logic says the evil from Iblees must come from Allah. So many contradictions from this channel.
the bee's nuts	2021-10-05T00:03:25Z	Assalaam, Dr hope your well, from this understanding how would one interpret the throne of Sheeba being taken by a jinn in the story of Suleiman and that jinn being an ifrit Much appreciated
A.Q Ahmed	2021-10-04T22:17:56Z	"I was his follower and subscribed to his channel. At first, I was fascinated by his weird and unorthodox explanation of the Quran; What he calls ""Organic Interpretation"" and ""Abrhamic Locution"" But later I realized that he was doing huge blunder by interpreting the Quran by means of his illogical whims. Finally I was totally stunned when he declared that there should not be a sacrifice of animals on Eidul Adh'ha day, a clear denial of the Sunnah of our prophet (SAW). I also suspected he belongs to Shia deviant sec. I personally asked him if he applauds Shia view of Islam, he refused to answer my question. I did some background checks on this guy. He used to work with big American and European military and Secret organizations like US-DoD. It would be interesting if told us what his role was in the Defense Department. What kind of a Muslim person would work for DoD which stands foe shedding the blood of innocent Muslims every day all over the world and helping the Zionist Israel with cutting-edge weapons and billions of dollars.

I Patel	2021-10-02T11:42:09Z	"Salaam Dr Hany According to Muhammad Asad in The Message of the Quran, the term Jinn has several distinct meanings: All classical philologists point out that al-jinn signifies ""intense [or ""confusing""] darkness"" and, in a more general sense, ""that which is concealed from [man' s] senses"". Creation of: Quran 15:27, 55:15, 7:12, 38:76. Nature of: 37:158, 6:100, 114:6. Organisms endowed with reason: 6:112, 7:38, 11:119, 32:13. Unseen beings as opposed to invisible beings. 46:29, 72:1. Please refer to Appendix 3 of his translations for the full script. This demonstrates that the use of this term connotes various levels /shades of meaning depending on the context. What is evident is that the Quran sheds light on one aspect of this term -the human preoccupation and fascination of ""occult powers"" or demonic forces -what we cannot physically observe with our senses, for a reason: To avoid succumbing to all paths that lead to shirk. The guiding/practical nature of the Quran points to this context probably because it was so embedded in the pre-modern world and still has implications today. We must understand this as it relates to the overall message of the Quran. What is important is not perceptions about the corporeal or the cerebral trinitarian nature of these forces, (because ultimately, Allah knows), but our unwavering commitment to seek only Allah's help."

Khulut Parveen	2021-10-01T16:44:38Z	I watched this video twice. Plus did 10 sec. Backward over and over again to get the concept thoroughly and more clear. This analysis explained is really enjoyable and it liberates us from the fear we have been living until now. It was so much to the extent that I literally feel creepy going up on the roof at late night and standing near my plants. I belive your interpretation but my mother still believes jinn to be a creepy invisible creature that can do massive tasks in a sec. (Sort of like magic) and she narrated out so many incidents. Though see believe In all of your previous interpretation.
ahmad zahidi Ismail	2021-10-01T09:23:24Z	more reason for me to believe that being a good servant of Allah it’s not about being over particular about performing the conventional salat, fasting, hajj, zakat, and the like.
Philotheos	2021-10-01T01:53:10Z	"This has me reflecting upon the nature of demonic possessions... are they purely psychological? Aren't there cases where ""possessed"" people say things outside their knowledge? A manifestation of their [cursed] subconscious that has not been dealt with? Perhaps iblees/alter ego is fully embodied when one has allowed his erroneous thoughts to freely occupy one's mind for too long. A defense mechanism? A chance to recognize one's faults and change accordingly?"

That takes a lot of course and may Allahh guide you in your path. I have updated my world views many times throughout my life. I am open to new ideas and views. I do agree with most of the stuff you say however I do not agree with the part about non existence of Jinn as separate creatures. It is unfortunate that you have not been exposed to Jinn or had any experience with any paranormal activity otherwise your views on this subject would have been different. Me, my family and friends have come across such experiences. If I had not experienced the paranormal activity then I would have accepted your views on the subject. I saw what I saw and heard what I heard personally and I cannot remove that experience. Allah knows best.

IronWater	2021-09-25T16:16:29Z	Audhu billahi minash shaitan nir rajim. Bismillahi rahmani rahim.. As salamu alaikum @Dr Hany, It is very very interesting about everything you are explaining, my beloved Prophet and Messenger PBUH needed also to explain a lot (day and night) of questions, not only Quran (somehow he did explain, tafsir, the Quran), but surely it wa in his time (1400y ago, and what people know and understand in his time, region, world, ect), so if he personally would write the Quran (which we don't have no evidence at all) that would have much much bigger impact (in negative way) in this days, he surely knew, (was guided) what and how was the correct way to write the Quran as you are trying to explain, it is in your explanation and verses of the Quran that shows that he didn't write (each of us may have different opinions and understanding, what will be the correct answer ???) , because ALLAH would not say that they blame him to have helpers to help him write the verses and also in other verses , if you stick to your explanation (Ibrahim locution) and that ALLAH says in the Quran dont use, go or take the poets way or language, the question rises : how can you say that ALLAH teaches us the story of Iblis (and meaning of Jinn) in a metaphorical way or theatrical, how comes that ALLAH uses illustrations to teach us, would not be to him to teach us what and why are we, what is good, bad or better for his creation, or who or what the enemies are with evidence ???what is with the matter of worshipping status or idols and not taking them as intermediary??? it never ends, does that mean that we didn't prostate to our self ???!!! (somehow there is no sense or its me who thinks to much, suffering from a tsunami?... Someone said : if you torture the text it will say that what you want to say ), the explanation you give somehow doesn't feet to the presented methodology. As we read and know that the poets always use the metaphoric language, because a book without that language will not have the desired impact or make any sense, how would you explain today's Dantes inferno or Injl, Torah? (and we know that the israelites claim that Musa AS wrote the Torah with his own hands) of course and for sure Quran is not man-made or poets literature or language (as ALLAH tells and shows us in Quran that those books are man-made and full of errors and contradictions ) , because how would the Quran be for all times and how would Sharia will be applied today, when a case is brought that we don't find nowhere in the history, in stories or elsewhere?! I think and it's my opinion (I could be totally wrong) that is injustice to prescribe something like that, my opinion is that there is something more, it may be that we need to stick something together or separate, I saw in your video that you cut a vese i thre pieces and put the middle of transition in the end of the translated verse, grammar is also needed (but you can't do that with the Quran) we need deeper understanding and sincere research(back to my beloved Prophet and Messenger PBUH, back to Quran), to not follow the path of the people of the book prescribed in Quran, we all know what they have done to their scripture, Alhamdulilah we still have the original, ALLAH protects Quran and says that there are signs for those who think , we have also many stories out of Quran , the scholar and Khalifa the story about claiming that Quran is the spoken word or created, the story when my beloved Prophet and Messenger PBUH chooses a man and asks him to how will he teach and apply sharia to the people if he doesn't find any explanation, ect. I'm still watching your videos, I only try to remember you of some important things in hope that you will understand what I'm trying to say , I wish I could express myself in a better way in English and I think I talked to much, this may be my last comment, ALLAH knows better our intentions. All praise, worship and everything what is in earth and heavens belongs to ALLAH, may ALLAH strengthen us and have mercy and guide us in the right path. Ameen
iraqchico	2021-09-25T10:05:55Z	You know what you just did Dr. Hany? You killed Satan 😅 The first part of the lecture is very tough and stressful, not easy to absorb. By the end and after listening to the whole, there definitely was a feel of peace, and understanding.
Jahgir Alom	2021-09-25T01:01:01Z	I have just finished watching this video a 2nd time around. Alhamdulillah, things were a lot clearer than the first time I watched it. These concepts answers questions relating to free will, accountability and the problem of evil and suffering! Alhamdulillah May Allah reward you and your team abundantly Dr Hany. May Allah help us all with understanding and accepting these critical concepts and allow the spreading of this knowledge to all the Ummah. Truly to Allah belong the command and to Him is our return and truly He is full of Mercy to ALL His creation. And indeed His creatures are numerous beyond anything we could ever count just as His favours to us are more numerous than what we could account for. Ameen
M Barron	2021-09-24T19:59:46Z	Dr Hany, surely the Jinn are not just figments of our imagination? Surely the sunnah and the experiences of many Muslims throughout the ages proves that the Jinn exist as separate beings/entities? They interact with us for both good and bad. I'm not convinced by your argument that the notion of the Jinn essentially comes from within us entirely
Nihad Samara	2021-09-24T12:58:31Z	(Then Satan tempted them in order to expose what was hidden of their nakedness. He said, “Your Lord has forbidden this tree to you only to prevent you from becoming angels or immortals. ) A'araf 20 ( them ) لهما so its three (thinking identities) . as per Freud's Theory the three parts are the id, ego and superego
Felicity	2021-09-24T09:15:53Z	Alhumdulillah. Alllah swt blessed you with such a good understanding and you are exposing it to His creation What could be better than this. Sir please also explain briefly in the light of this video how should we understand surah Falak and surah Nas ( 113 , 114 ) Thankyou
Changbin Seo2	2021-09-24T08:01:13Z	Dr. Hany, I want to ask you what is the meaning of مِنَ الْجِنَّةِ وَالنَّاسِ Is there any other meaning of وَالنَّاسِ beside mankind? Edit: I just realized you will explain it later. I'll patiently wait. Thank you
Changbin Seo2	2021-09-24T07:10:31Z	Thank you
Naeem Khan Khalil	2021-09-24T06:38:01Z	Correction plz at 24:14 the verse is not 18-52 its 18-82 ✔ (seems typo mistake) 👍
Melinda Arrmegeddon	2021-09-24T04:01:26Z	Selams so I wanted to clarify, iblees is a real creation but he's mission manifests from within our own inner inclinations to do evil and he uses this part of us to deter us from the correct path using those aspects you mentioned? Also, you are saying that even though he is a real creation doing a real job, he did not actually have any discussions with Allah and that is there more as an example to us rather than a actual event. JzkAllah Khayr.
Isaam Rafee	2021-09-24T00:35:12Z	Salams Dr Hani… does the Quran say anything about earth? Is it a sphere or its a flat plane with mountains.. forgive me if its a Red herring but im just curious.. salams 😀
gerald etienne	2021-09-23T21:36:21Z	Best presentation by far!!! Alhamdulillah! Now that you've helped us understand the nature and definition of Iblis, can you also help us understand the concept of malaikac/angel?
Khaled Swaleh Karama	2021-09-23T21:07:51Z	May ALLAH guide us ,..
GURMAD TV	2021-09-23T16:44:31Z	mashallah
sadia ali	2021-09-23T15:08:32Z	If and when we are able to understand Iblees and defeat him, and our connections established with Allah SWT, will our Dreams become more guided? Do dreams have a value?
marionjah2	2021-09-23T11:08:00Z	Now I understand why in ancient days people use FIRE for ILLUMINATION like Zoroastrian, Majusi n many practices / culture that involves fire and burning…even till today, fire is part of some religious events….for example cremation, bonfires, candles and even Olympic torch/flame…..Hmmm💁🏼
Nihad Samara	2021-09-23T10:47:21Z	Great work Dr. Hani , How about considering subconscious as the Qareen and Jinn as physical description also Shytan ( as animal nature of action and reactions ) and Nar as the power nature of knowledge ( waves ) , the subconscious is uncontrolled by human brain and its a source of self inspiration add to that its the center of desires of the human , it was the boss before the upgrade of Adam . when man was closer to the animal category . please look at it from this side , you may see things in a better way than I do. but still could not figure out Zouj ... who is that third Godly partner in human nature is it the rouh ( الروح ) , is it the third partner as Angelic connection . where is that physical part in human body . if it should have a place human body ?
TruthLifeFinder	2021-09-23T07:20:37Z	"Wa alaikum salam, Dr, You have done an excellent and brilliant job. May Allah bless you and adds more aids to you in all forms forever, amin. Not sure whether you have realized this or not, you have just killed the entire population of the ""birds"" in the universe with ""one stone"", metaphorically. In the Quran, Allah mentions that when the Truth is revealed at your very own eyes :- The ""100% Submitters to The Creator"" remain in the Truth path while the ""Rejectors"" remain in the unpleasant path toward unpleasant dwellings. This is one of the sign that the ""END TIME"" is just round the corner. So reflect, whether you are a Muslim or not, before the ""DOOR"" is completely closed for repentance. This is not a game. it is a matter of survival in the life after ""DEAD"". ""The TRUTH remains the TRUTH"". We can argue in many ways, We can counter-argue until we are ""BLUE IN THE FACE"". The TRUTH remains the TRUTH (period). May Allah continuously bless all of us forever, as the last ummah, in the TRUTH PATH and end up in the ""MOST UN-IMAGINABLE PLEASANT DWELLINGS"". Wassalam."
sadia ali	2021-09-23T06:13:22Z	Assalamunalicum Dr Hanny, this concept is so like Chines Yin/Yan. that says each person has good and evil within and there is a constant fight between the two, when the evil wins a fiery dragon comes out! Chines is an oldest civilization, makes me wonder, this, may be taught to them by a prophet. and is preserved in the chines myths. Thank you so much for the explanation. I got so scared of myself, I don't want to loose to my lesser self.
InsafDiri	2021-09-23T05:03:48Z	So beautiful.... Thank you... I pray Allah provide Dr Hany and his team with good health and protect them from Iblees always. Aameen... ❤😘❤😘❤😘
Burhan Long	2021-09-23T02:35:15Z	I hope in future segments, Dr Hany will share with us the nuanced differences between 4:1 and 7:189 and 39:6. Regards
Taurini Gem	2021-09-22T22:05:27Z	I am surprised Dr Hany what a deep and good analysis we all went through may God bless you with more knowledge health and life so that you may present us more knowledge.
sharazi sha	2021-09-22T21:49:23Z	How do you explain the story of Sulaiman A.S In the Quran, it says something like, It wasn’t Sulaiman who disbelieved but it was the Jin or shayteen They thought people magic. Also, the part where it talks about, how Sulaiman passed away and the Jin didn’t know that he was dead. Until they saw the ants eating away at his wooden stick.
Nafisa Yasin	2021-09-22T20:44:29Z	Amazingly put. I had this concept for a long time but you have detailed it perfectly that resonates. Thankyou Dr Hany. Alhumdullilah for all knowledge that leads to the truth.
Islam The Best Religion	2021-09-22T20:13:35Z	I saw it with few people having possessed of something which have more power, suddenly speaking in different manner, demanding,and damaging thier organs and tissues and if a perfume applied on them suddenly they came out and speak with different tone and volume. Especially with woman at maghrib time they got the possession and its very famous in india that dont go on terrist or outdoor unveiling your head at maghrib time. So if its not jinn what it is? Is it iblees who can overcome on someone?or is it possible that one iblees of different human want or can entered to different body like rooh travels and sleep is half death without rooh? What about the aayat of surah yasin the jinn and the ins? And if jinn is not a creature then is iblees is a single different creature? In a hadith i read about yazuz and mazuz, bani adam and bani iblees. I understood that iblees got a task and he want every human to be like him he can enter into blood and in our mind he want us to ride in darkness means misguidance and to take us away from the light mean pure guidance and understanding the correct methodology of quran. Plz explain i cannot fix it because of lots of stuff i have watched with my own eyes with my own relatives and there are lots of aayat and hadith which talk about jinn and iblees and shaitan, shayateen.
Sabah Kapadia	2021-09-22T17:55:33Z	Asalāmu’alaikim Sir, After hearing and understanding of this segment. I am in a shock , it feels like we have been hypnotised to a total different path of understanding of the Quran for centuries. We have been blindfolded and made to falsely understand about Adam, Eve , Iblees and Jinn’s etc. Sir, what is the truth behind the story of the magic performed on our beloved prophet Mohammed by the Jews . Now my conscious is not allowing me to believe any story narrated in the name of the Quran or all our prophets. I need your guidance for five times salah. May Almighty Allah bless you and keep you in good health . Sincere Thanks 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 Waiting anxiously for the QURAN in English …………..
Anon Amos	2021-09-22T13:17:08Z	Salam Alikum brother, your new format is so much better, by adding the text rather than just saying these things as before hand in the past. It really does add to give strength to your claim that previous false interpretations need to be corrected and this is why you are repeating it over and over, I take back what was about your long winded introductions, said by me before I now see this is needed to tell those watching, it's time to throw away those traditional miss-interpretations.
AATIF KHAN	2021-09-22T12:11:57Z	"How many of you smile when Dr Hany says ""hmmmmm makes senses now"" this is what, this is what it is.. and clears our misconceptions just by the sigh.. i do always smile.. thank you Dr Hany.. may allah always keep you blessed and in good health.. jazak allah.."
Jahgir Alom	2021-09-22T09:11:55Z	"The Koran cries out even to the last day, ""O people, given up as a prey to ignorance, If ye have imagined me to be only empty fables, Ye have sown the seed of reviling and infidelity. Ye yourselves who abuse me will see yourselves Annihilated, and made like a tale that is told!"" Rumi - The Masnavi"
Mo Qa	2021-09-22T05:16:44Z	Dr hani can you please give a list of good tafsir books? thanks and regards!

Batool	2021-09-22T03:25:15Z	Doctor can you speak on what a muslim woman should look like? Regarding the hijab. & can you please discuss what the law is on tattoos from the Quran ? Your videos are amazing thank you so much.
Mohomad Sheriffdeen	2021-09-22T00:17:42Z	We were discussing the things among my friends, I have 2 question for clarification. 1. Surah Al-Imraan:59 Isa and Adam parable 2. Considering overall with Schemas and Shaytan altering schemas, and now Iblis as Duo please explain it more. Thanks and your work is much appreciated.

Fahim Lafir	2021-09-21T20:46:03Z	"Assalaamu alaikum wa rahmatullaahi wa barakatahu. The greater challenge for me was to completely view the whole video - it took me almost seven attempts. Yes we were warned by you of the possible distractions and it happened. Anyway the reverberations will take time to sink in and Bi Iznillaah the full picture will be clearer ( plenty of unlearning to do to clear the old ""files"" in the head. Allaahumma Ihdeena wa Saddidnaa alas SIRAATHAL MUSTAQEEM. Barakallaahufeekuma"
Neehal Yazid	2021-09-21T19:39:08Z	Could you please clarify .. From surat Alnas اذي يوسوس في صدور الناس من الجن والناس؟ It seems here that humans are separate from jin. Also the story about the jin listening to the quran and the mosque in Saudi that is named the jin mosque? Please clarify so I can fully understand. Thank you.
Majid Siddiqui	2021-09-21T15:31:51Z	Intresting lecture, intresting interpretations. Reminiscent of the sufi master Mansur Hallaj’s encounter with iblees. Counter to your argument though I would say there is much evidence in all cultures that these creatures which are accepted as Jinn exsist, how about the hadiths that mention jinn. How about hadith that mention Jinn have tribes and animals in the same way humans do. You would have us beleive these are all lies, but they are not.
AllTruthRevealed	2021-09-21T15:11:41Z	Salam Dr Hany. Can you please clarify how there was a 'time' before the 'inception' of the Quran?
Ahamar Rifat	2021-09-21T14:27:45Z	Masyallah what a fantastic presentation - it makes so much sense. This concurs with many ideas and concepts I have reflected on over the years. I always felt deep down that the quran was misrepresented.
BOBA BORU	2021-09-21T13:05:55Z	Assalam aleykum once again. Thanks for your clarification on shajarah. Kindly shed some light on 20:116,117. 20:116 talks about the same iblis in surah baqara. 20:117 talks about the enemy to both Adam and his zawj. So how can we conclude here that zawj here is again ibliis. Thanks.
The_Sign10	2021-09-21T10:12:40Z	Your segments are a breath of fresh air may Allah keep blessing you and preserve you! Dr I would love a future segment about the Quranic salat using this methodology

Request are many But Few (1)Your Translation of Quran , Lectures on (1) What Really Sallat Means 5 times daily Prayers, are we following in true sense....(2) Allahh is Light of Samavaat & Ardh in Sure Noor (2) On Ashabe Kahaf. People of the Cave. Allahh Increase Knowledge in you. Thank you So Much"
Zainuddin	2021-09-21T03:54:14Z	Assalamualaikum. I refer to surah al jinn verses 11 and 14. According to the tafsir there are some good jinns (soolihuun , muslimuun) and some are bad jinns. So how do we reconcile this with your definition of jinn ? Tq
Sofia Chaudry	2021-09-21T03:54:00Z	I am a big fan of your work and I am in full agreement with you regarding nested interpretation. I think you would agree that this channel is not for blind followers. We are all on critical thinking approach. I have few questions regarding the concept of Jinn. 1- If we consider Jinn is not a different entity, instead we humans are Naas or Jinn depending upon the what/who do we follow, then how do we explain , Surah Rehman Ayat 14-15. (I am sure you have considered them in the nested interpretation and you may explain at some stage later). 2- If we consider these above mentioned Ayats of creation by SALSAAL AND FIRE are in metaphorical sense, then it is a BIG SHAKE to believe. How do we justify/believe 'what is metaphorical and what is real in Quran'? 3- Considering so, some of the Ayats are metaphorical or some stories are theatrical, it seems this book is very difficult for an ordinary minded person. The one with high intelligence, too much wisdom from Allah, and spending a lot of time on Quran may be able to understand. But not the majority. Masses of the people CAN NOT spend that long time to understand the Quran. That refers this book is not for masses to understand. How does that work?
Believer One	2021-09-21T02:54:47Z	With all due respect sir, you are just twisting everything , adding meanings and looking for things that are not even there.....Quran is very clear in its meaning and its message but you are really twisting completely and trying to find things that are not there.
Mohamed Uvaish	2021-09-21T02:26:02Z	@Marvelous Quran: based on this video, how do you explain the last Ayat of surah An-Nas: مِنَ ٱلْجِنَّةِ وَٱلنَّاسِ, why Jiinn and Mankind are separated here.
Ajeeb believer	2021-09-21T00:30:47Z	I really appreciate Dr. Hany's effort to explain it in a different way. And lots of it make sense but I think he is also making some mistakes. Just as the old translations have many unanswered questions so does Dr. Hany's explanations. But I appreciate his effort. Jazzk Allah Dr. Hany.
BOBA BORU	2021-09-20T22:41:03Z	Assalam aleykum Dr Hanny. Kindly elaborate on 48: 18 using your nested interpretation. Shajara is the word. Assalam aleykum.
IronWater	2021-09-20T21:00:49Z	"Audhu billahi minash shaitan nir rajim. Bismillahi rahmani rahim. As salamu alaikum @Dr Hany, I am a new subscriber and came by coincidence to your channel a few days ago , it was an interesting video and started to watch some others, I said let's give it a try and decided to whatch all your videos from the beginning and read through the comments and it came the newest one. I always try and seek the truth and in some or in another way my questions becomes answered, never in my life made any comment on you tube. I have no clue about Arabic language, yet you're claiming that the Quran it's not all in Arabic, but you are translating it from Arabic?!? how comes that you referring to the methodology ""Ibrahim locution"" yet you are using some hieroglyph piktogramm (""in other videos to prove your translation and saying that there are also other ways"") , BTW who defined that locution?!? And now you presented us a book!?! translated a word in many other meanings! dose that means we can peak an choose any meaning that we want without locution?!? we know that Quran is for all times and a translation is the meaning of the translator and not the meaning of the spoken word in the Quran, you simply saying to throw everything in garbage (""empty your cup""), what when another you comes after 1400y and says ""empty your cup everything you know is wrong???"". Englisch is not my mother language, I may be not so good expressing myself in English but still trying to write English, how comes that My beloved Prophet and Messenger PBUH didn't explain (""tafsir"") Quran!!! did ALLAH SWT gave him Quran and said, now deal with it?!!! how comes that suddenly he did know how to write and read, where are the accusations from his enemies in his time as we know that he dealt with Jewish, christians and polytheist people??? how could he dealt with them and explain to them things??? how did Islam spread so quickly ??? how did the companions survive and were not betrayed from the King in Abyssinia??? how did Heraclius understand the letter as he questioned Abu Suffian??? what about Surah Ar Rahman and many others Surah's!?! what about the other verses in Quran where ALLAH SWT explains the conversation with Iblis on the day of judgement??? how did my beloved Prohet and Messenger PBUH explain and prescribe Jerusalem to the polytheist's, the claim, when he was in the night jurney??? ect You are presenting your translation (tafsir) on YouTube to not Academics! in hope waiting for Academics to engage with you, waiting answers and ideas from not Academics for further research, and you don't like the way how some of us are writing to you as I can read in some comments. Why are you presenting to us blurry pieces of the puzzle? why not presenting the whole translation!?! why don't you present your research, translation (tafsir) in Mecca and Medina? why you don't engage directly with the Academics but waiting them to engage with you???. As someone who criticize you should be very aware that you will be criticized (me to), I hope you will understand what I'm trying to say, I think I gave you many useful ideas, for sure you may delete this whole statement and of course it's only my opinion, at the end, my response is the same as Abu Bakr's response to Meccan's when my beloved Prophet and Messenger claimed that he was in the night journey, and my response for the Quran is the same as my beloved Prophet and Messenger PBUH responded to the Jewish rabies when they brought the Torah scroll in front of him. From a simple sincere beliver who tries to please ALLAH and seek the truth. All praise and worship belongs to ALLAH, may ALLAH have mercy and guide me in the right path and all those who strive to go the right path, Ameen"
Suleman Qamar	2021-09-20T20:15:52Z	Sorry, I won't believe all the information that you provided in this video, illogical, where is methodology? And surah JINN, please read it with empty Cup or glass and true mind and open heart. JAZAKAallahh, may all put his blessings on all ADAMS
Engine Jedi	2021-09-20T20:12:58Z	Hello mr Hany, loved it, amazing, i mean wowww, where are we really, what is really going on? What we believe in really? If what you tell is our religion, than what were we believing untill now? And if we include what you still have not told us, i mean i believed in black magic like 100 %
Suleman Qamar	2021-09-20T20:11:48Z	Salaam everyone, if jinn and humans are same, why Al quran addressed in Surah RAHMAAN, OO GROUP OF JINN AND MAN..?
Tabrez Gangee	2021-09-20T19:50:13Z	"As Salaam U Alaykum Dr Hany, thank you for this wonderful lecture, so many things to learn, i'm loving it. Please can you clarify these points for me. Thanks. 1. What is the difference between Zawj & Imraah (As in Surah 111:4 & 29:32). Before this lecture i thought both were synonymous meaning ""wife"" and that the term Imraah was always associated with ""bad"" wife, as the wife of Lut AS. If Zawj means Counterpart, does Imraah also means the same? 2. According to the Quran, As human beings are we the only ones Allah created with free will? 3. In light of this lecture, am i right to say that, in computer terminology that Iblees is a sub-program in our system required to perform a specific sets of instructions given by Allah. And as such it is not ""classified"" as a creature by definition in itself (like the animals, humans, angels)? 4. If the answer to the question No. 3 is true, then why (am asking for the sake of learning, not questioning Allah) has Allah constructed the verse ""when We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam”; so they prostrated, except for Iblees"" as if the Angels and Iblees were two creatures one opposing and one accepting instructions when in reality, Iblees is just a set of instructions embedded in our nafs? May Allah give you strength to continue and health in abundance. Ameen"
Safety	2021-09-20T18:50:49Z	When we understand that Allah already knew how Iblis and Melaika would respond to His command, then perhaps we will realize that what Allah says is for us to understand His plan.
Shairs Ko	2021-09-20T17:32:52Z	Do any other academics accept your research? If not why not? Because I’m seeing totally revolutionary ideas coming from you!
Tuwan Mashaikah	2021-09-20T17:19:02Z	Use the HADITH and IJMAH and QURAN itself to explain the verses of the quran instead of your LOGICAL human intellect..Avoid falling into deep misguidance..May Allah have mercy on us to guide us in a straight path..!!!
Wajid Ali	2021-09-20T16:41:12Z	Excellent explanation
marionjah2	2021-09-20T16:05:53Z	This is really a Heavy duty Serial…But Alhamdullilah I learn so very much…it opens up to so many ambiguity about iblis….dr Hany in surah Al Falaq does “GHASIQIN IZA WAQAB” refers to creeping of iblis on humans caught unaware….
muse aweys	2021-09-20T15:19:55Z	Good stuff
Mike Pasigan	2021-09-20T15:08:46Z	How about chapter 51 ayat 56?
Falonchi Pismadonchi	2021-09-20T14:55:11Z	I mean I didn't get what he is saying There are groups of jins, there is tons of hadis about it which is most of them are sahih
Tariq Alam	2021-09-20T14:46:42Z	"Dear Brother Hanny, Thank you very much for your contribution to extract insights from Al-Quran in order for us to understand, practice and get close to Allah swt. May Allah swt reward and bless you. Here, I like to put some of my humble opinions for your review - 1. Historically, there is something called the Principle of Correspondence, what does that mean is what is inside us also outside us. So, everything out there is also in there (us). Many scholars refer to this hadith - ""Allah created man in His own image"" and also ""He who knows himself knows his Lord"". Some say, Hazrat Ali also said, the whole universe is also within us. You have several videos about Jannat in a metaphoric sense, it is within us as we feel like we are living in Jannah. If you think that way then everything in nature or every creation of Allah swt lives within us as an attribute. In other ways, all creations are used as metaphors for us to learn and apply. From this point of view “Iblees” and Jinn are also creations and at the same time, their attributes/characteristics exist within us. So that we can learn from those creations and follow the correct path. It is similar to learning from other animals. So, Iblees and Jinn within us do not mean they cannot be outside of us. If I follow the Principle of Correspondence then they (Iblees and Jinn) have to be outside of us in order for their attributes to existing in us. In another way, If Iblees and Jinn are not creations outside of us then we will not have those attributes with us. A human is the mirror of all creations of the universe. 2. You also mention there are Seven layers of understanding, then why everyone needs to agree with one person's understanding. Honestly, when I listened to your lectures I received many different understandings. For example, when you said “I am also an adam, and every generation has adam” then clearly tells me the description also includes the first Adam. I do not see any conflict considering that adam is - first human or Adam, the prophet Musa as an adam, the prophet Isa as an adam; the Prophet Muhammad sws as an adam and you or someone else as an adam in that context. So, these Ayats cover the story of Adam (first human) and also every generational adam for that context. So it proves Ayats of Al-Quran never expired. May Allah swt bless all of us and give us the understanding to get close to Him. Thanks"
yusufk	2021-09-20T14:40:16Z	Sorry, to continue my previous thread, you could have easily argued using Abrahamic locution that jinn and human are 2 different species but you chose to argue that they are one and the same
yusufk	2021-09-20T14:37:27Z	Salams Dr Hany, i have watched all your videos, they all make sense and i find them very interesting. However at times i feel you are using poetic licence. So whilst i am not disagreeing with your interpretation i think that you (as in you personally) could easily justify the existence of 2 species using the Abrahamic locution. So for instance the word counterpart zawj could be assumed to be a separate species of Jinn. Just my thoughts and i think it depends which angle you are coming from and depending on ones W you could justify anything
Jaiton Ghani	2021-09-20T13:47:49Z	Alhamdulillah Aamiin MaasyaAllah thanks Dr Hany now how can I go about sharing the divine messages to my loved ones…..have tried sharing previous segments but to no response meanwhile just kept on Duaa for them in shaa Allah looking forward to hear more from you…
Neehal Yazid	2021-09-20T13:22:08Z	Your content is very educational and interesting, my only critic is that in the beginning it takes too long to hear about ‘ how to take in this info’ I think people who are interested will already get it without this lengthy explanation in the beginning of each video.
S3v3N FR33	2021-09-20T13:17:39Z	So would you say we are journeying through the past to understand what we have accumulated because the suggestion of ppl being in Jahannam suggests judgement has been executed already which implies we are living in a different consciousness
S3v3N FR33	2021-09-20T13:14:13Z	A very unique look and I do appreciate you providing an academic dissecting of these labels this gives the reader a very different understanding. I value u addressing the concept of eve especially
ABC 999	2021-09-20T12:07:31Z	Another childhood story, do Angels reside on our shoulders and recording our deeds? We are fully confident of Allahh's SWT knowledge is eternal and perfect 💯💯💯
Shameem Kabir	2021-09-20T07:02:35Z	Dear Dr Hany! Assalamualaikum. The Ref of 18.52 looks got typo. It should be 18:82. Thanks. Kabir
Wan Aishah Wan hamid	2021-09-20T06:42:34Z	You have dropped a bomb Dr Hany! An earth shattering exposition…..MashaAllah! The little wait/Al Akhirah from you is superbly amazingly mind boggling and ugly! After the 4hrs long with pauses and staring into the blank asking God for purpose of this creation while rain drops from the sights……was exhausting while fighting the counterpart of course! Followed by a sleepless night…..trying to comprehend surah Jinn! If for those already striving on this path were shaken to the core……simply cannot imagine this to the world masses out there! MashaAllah. Getting this into the main stream feels like an impossible tasks Dr Hany……but Allah S.W.T’s Will will get done InshaAllah. Sooo soo grateful for this piece as it melts it all down to the very core. Also felt as if the life vein being snapped! How can we not be grateful to the delivery person who has toiled for so many years just to give it to us on a silver platter, ALHAMDULILLAH. May we all be able to join you in that segret abode of yours Dr Hany InshaAllah. Thank you soo so very much. Forever indebted. Wasalam
Eusz	2021-09-20T05:58:33Z	Nice... a little bit more the we will know who we really are..
Kazim Nasar	2021-09-20T05:55:25Z	The best of the videos from you!! I was extremely impressed with the knowledge. May Allah Bless you.
Hakman Tim	2021-09-20T05:43:39Z	This seems like a good video, I hope I can watch it when I have time.
MKZ	2021-09-20T05:01:38Z	What is your advice to someone who don't know about classical Arabic language? Do we have to learn first Arabic to go to coranic language? What is the first step for a rookie? Thank you very much Sir
Abdul Hamid	2021-09-20T03:54:26Z	Hellooo My dear brother Dr Hany you got honey in your heart may Allah Himself bless and help you in your wonderful work in helping our Muslims in understanding the Holy Quran as it should and must be understood.We Muslims pray to Allah that you and your family will have a good healthy and wealthy life and always do your good job with the help of Almighty Allah.Alhamduillah
Azman Shamsuddin	2021-09-20T03:13:54Z	Thank you very much Dr.Hany.❤️ Iblis, satan and jin are actually human beings.
ABC 999	2021-09-20T02:41:09Z	AlHamdulillah ‼ Thank you Dr. Hany for the Sakinah I'm receiving from You, well enjoying the fruits of Jannah Olives, Dates, Grapes Pomegranates and Figs that results from Al Aakirah, the delayed diligent interpretation. Finally we are what we feed our mind.....
Mustafa Eravsar	2021-09-20T00:33:23Z	Selam Dr Hany, Your concept and explanation I believe is logical with verses in the Quran that state: that God has given the Nafs its righteousness and wickedness and whoever purifies his/her Nafs is successful and God also says: We know what the Nafs whispers to him. To me this proves that the only logical explanation of Iblees is that we all have an allocated Iblees part of our Nafs that incites and influences our behaviour and reasoning, not only with the Quran but every day life, so we need to strive to purify and cleanse the brain fog so we can allow God to guide us to his way and not jump to conclusions, it’s a life long journey. Many Jinn (another creation) running around whispering into billions of people to misguide us was always a silly concept in my view. I always believed the struggle was with ones self. Thank you for this video it was a great help.
Carol Kirby	2021-09-20T00:30:53Z	Alhamdulillah What a relief !
Legacies	2021-09-19T23:44:53Z	Q: Before this segment, most of us thought iblees will live till the end of time! How about the angels? Does quran say how long they live? Are there some dead angels?
Legacies	2021-09-19T23:29:47Z	Question: why is it called Iblees? Does it have a meaning in Abrahamic locution such as Adam means to be selected, or Is-haka the one who was striked? Also, you have not defined the words min qablihim in one of those final ayats.
Bill Gates	2021-09-19T22:42:41Z	Becoz how wud prophet explain bacteria n virus 1400yrs ago to illiterate people. Match that description to the description of bacteria n virus now .
Bill Gates	2021-09-19T22:40:08Z	May Allah help u n bless u in ur efforts. I want to put up ...mayb u find it silly...plz forgive me if so... cud it be that jinns are bacteria and iblees is a virus who corrupts wen it infects either human body or bacterial body. Coz there r gud n bad humans n jinns. Those corrupted by virus r bad. If our spiritual immune system overpowers the virus we r gud ????
darth vader	2021-09-19T22:13:55Z	Absolutely mind blowing lecture, thanks dr hany.
KM nasir	2021-09-19T21:20:40Z	"Qun Faya Qun/Be And It Becomes. Plz Reflect; Allah Subhana Ta'ala created Adam when he blew Soul in the First Live Cell with the potential to become Adam, Ashraf Ul Makhlooqat. Al Baqar 2; 30,31. "" And remember when ur Lord said to the Angels; ' verily I'm going to create a Khalifa on earth......"" implies celestial time during which Adam was being created. How does it reconcile with "" Be and it becomes """
Legacies	2021-09-19T21:14:08Z	Please Dr. in the next segment when you talk about shaytan, can you also address sihr( 'witchcraft')? And how shaytan taught people Sihr
K A	2021-09-19T21:04:48Z	Wonderful!
Shabel Tv	2021-09-19T20:37:19Z	You misleading People jinn are the same family as iblis for you to misinterpret the surahs is wrong and is devilish in my opinion. Jinns are created from smokless fire and ibless from fire. They existed before us and They did misschiefs and corruptions now we can see them but They watching us You didnt mention that surah too People can be also devilish like you are doing now by misleading People Quran 6:112 And thus We have made for every prophet an enemy - devils from mankind and jinn, inspiring to one another decorative speech in delusion. But if your Lord had willed, they would not have done it, so leave them and that which they invent.
Ain Al	2021-09-19T20:15:38Z	"At 1:32:00 Q7 - shajarah - not tree but the group of argumentative deceivers. 2:35 & 4:1 - zawj as a counterpart within. The translation for ""shajarah"" commonly known so far always seemed incomplete to me. I wasn't sure about ""zawj"" as a spouse or mate or pair. However, both the explanation is a total paradigm shift for me. SubhanAllah, it makes so much more sense and has brought about a ton of relief. A time stamp for sections will be appreciated. This will help us in going back later to listen to specific sections again. Also, either a pdf that could be downloaded or a simple website where one could refer to the entire text in the presentation will be helpful. This will help us refresh our memory of the presentation and remember better when we browse through the text next time. Seems like the more the means, the more help we need....lol!"
Mohamed H	2021-09-19T20:06:34Z	In the light of this interpretation of aya 2:35 the following narration makes perfect sense: وعن عبد الله بن مسعود قال : قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم : ما منكم من أحدٍ إلا وقد وكِّل به قرينه من الجن ، قالوا : وإياك يا رسول الله ؟ قال : وإياي ، إلا أن الله أعانني عليه فأسلم فلا يأمرني إلا بخير . it seems the prophet pbuh is referring to the Aya because he know his jinn is defeated.
Amazing Amazigh	2021-09-19T19:45:17Z	"allot of good information and i learned allot,BUT i have one point i cant agree with, Djannah meaning concealed knowledge. Sometimes dear brother you talk as if the arabic language is an independant alien language, eventhough its a semetic language and is tied to other semetic language and the term Djannah is related to GAN in Canaanite/Hebrew/Assyrian and it means in all the other branches of the semetic family Garden, like in Djannati 3adn which is in hebrew Gan Adan. And even the semetic family is a branch of an older family which is the afro-asiatic languages from which is also my native language ""Tamazight""(ancient-Libic), in our language Gan or in its feminine form ""Ta-GAN-t"" means Forest/Jungle which is the most primitive forms and meaning of the word Djannah. so concealed and covered could be a descriptive poetic style to Forest/Jungle but even then why would we not take the apparant clear meaning ??"
Areal Juarge-Qattan	2021-09-19T19:05:10Z	Dr Atchan; fascinating work; would it please be possible to kindly place clickable tabs along the horizontal x time axis thereby sectioning and chaptering all your videos.Students can benefit from reference points and embedded bookmarks that where it corresponds to your titled sections and chapters; (would be greatly appreciated and beneficial) for following, noting and re-referencing different pars of these lectures. many thanks. salamat.
Ербол Ербол	2021-09-19T19:03:57Z	"Iblees was from the jinn or became one of the jinn. What does ""kaana"" mean, was or became? Forexample when it is said ""kaana min al-kafireen"" some translate ""he became one of the rejecters. Iblees was or became a jinn? I really did not understand from your lecture how Iblees being a representative of a jinn, who are corrupt human beings according to you, is not a human but a counterpart of adam? Or can it be that Iblees is a human and adam is his counterpart when he gets corrupted? Please can you explain?"
S O	2021-09-19T18:42:36Z	Aslm..I've learnt more about the Quran, through your segments and lectures, than Ive learnt in any no. of lectures throughout my years...Alhamdulilah...this ties in everything regarding what we go through in our day to day life..and gives us the power to choose.. Many Thanks😁Glory be to Allahh!☝🏼
Ain Al	2021-09-19T18:21:49Z	"At 17 min everything became clear when I learnt 'il-la' does not require what is before and after to be of the same genre. Excellent, so far I haven't come across anyone giving this explanation. From the rest of the ayat it is as clear as day light that iblees was not an Angel. To being with, using Quran corpus one could gather all the ayat relating to ibless and go over it multiple times. I think with most of us the only confusion was how the word ""except"" is applied in English vs how it is used in the Quran.... understanding locution is so critical to proper interpretation."
Ербол Ербол	2021-09-19T18:21:15Z	Interesting thing to note, there is a hadith saying that Iblees has established his throne over the water. It must be a metaphorical coded language?
Ербол Ербол	2021-09-19T18:03:27Z	"I'm not an arabic native speaker. I wonder if ""galaika lagna"" means a responsibility of curse upon you, how will be then in arabic ""you are cursed""? Lagannak Allah? Is it correct?"
Omar M Y	2021-09-19T17:39:06Z	Alhamdulillah, forever grateful.
canada man	2021-09-19T17:03:19Z	SIR COULD IT BE Qorin as our counterpart known as Nafs..?😇
gamester boys	2021-09-19T16:59:18Z	Alhamdhulillah Dr. Hany..... this lecture brought goose bumps to me... few months back I was contemplating on iblees and remembered a hadith which says - shaithan runs in the blood of the son of Adam...this made me realise that iblees must be a part of our nafs...to double clarify I wrote to a sheik I knew and he said he will get back to me. ...but he still dint... ...and voila I came across this lecture ..I'm a non Arab speaking person ...I don't know how I got to know this...and you confirmed what I realised. . alhamdhulillah is all what I have to say... May Allah bless u...
Zool Othman	2021-09-19T16:18:10Z	I actually came to this conclusion but of course without proper technical evidences. your work enlightened my beliefs.
Samshur Rahman	2021-09-19T16:17:14Z	Mind blowing Mr Dr Hany thanks
Zool Othman	2021-09-19T16:17:01Z	amazing work. very much needed in this age of rampant blind following. May Allah reward you for your works!
yusufk	2021-09-19T15:43:57Z	Salams Dr Hany. What about the references to Jinn re Sulaiman alaihissalam?
surge fx	2021-09-19T15:43:22Z	"MasyaAllahh.. Its all make sense now. Does ""purified spouse"" in Al-Baqarah 2:25 related to this presentation?"
Arif	2021-09-19T15:32:37Z	Mind-blowing and almost unacceptable if we insist on our own knowledge and perception. Now this make me wonder: 1. What is insaan/an-naas (human being as creature? Or something else in it?) 2. What is malaaikat actually?
Raja Azman Raja Awang	2021-09-19T15:16:35Z	When I was a kid, my naive mind wondered why the iblees who believe in the presence of god and his punishment are willing to take the final place in hell-fire rather than repenting for his faults (I never get satisfaction answer for the question). I used to feel sorry for the iblees when I was a kid (actually until now). I'm afraid to even think about the matter because the ulama's viewpoint was too strong. I'm still not sure which is the right one, but this one is more evidence-based.
Rosli Kamaruddin	2021-09-19T14:49:12Z	Salamunalaikum Dr Hany, kindly explain 6:112. Thank you.
Paulo Sousa	2021-09-19T14:46:11Z	Jinn isn’t the separate creature, separate from us? There is a jinn in every one of us? { وَأَنَّا لَا نَدْرِي أَشَرٌّ أُرِيدَ بِمَن فِي الْأَرْضِ أَمْ أَرَادَ بِهِمْ رَبُّهُمْ رَشَدًا } [الجن:10] رَبُّهُمْ ... و ليس ربنا إذا، رب الجن ليس هو نفسه رب الإنس كيف يكون ذلك ممكن، و منهم مسلمون ؟ { وَأَنَّا مِنَّا الْمُسْلِمُونَ وَمِنَّا الْقَٰسِطُونَ فَمَنْ أَسْلَمَ فَأُولَٰئِكَ تَحَرَّوْا رَشَدًا } [الجن:14]. كيف لمسلم من الجن أن يكون له رب مختلف عن رب المسلم المنتمي للإنس ؟ رَبُّهُمْ ... و ليس ربنا عندما تجد الإجابة على هذا السؤال البسيط ستكتشف بنفسك من هم فعلا الجن بالتوفيق
Effizan Aly	2021-09-19T14:44:58Z	Assalammualaikum Dr. How about sihr? Since we were taught or made to believe that sihr and jinns are intertwined.

ياسفي Yasfi	2021-09-19T14:15:49Z	"Salamun alaikum. Thank you for the beautiful lecture, Dr. Only one part that bothering me.. 2:15:11 you said that the conversation between Allah and Iblees isn't real but theatrical.. Which means Allah lied to us (audzubillah audzubillah)? In surah Yusuf verse 111 Allah Azza wa' Jalla said: ""There was certainly in their stories a lesson for those of understanding. Never was the Qur’an a narration invented, but a confirmation of what was before it and a detailed explanation of all things and guidance and mercy for a people who believe."" Also in surah An Nisa 87 : ""Allah – there is no deity except Him. He will surely assemble you for the Day of Qiyamah, about which there is no doubt. And who is more truthful than Allah in statement."" Are we ready to open the ""hole"" that there is Qur'an's story which isn't real? Then how about other stories that Allah told us? Subhanallah.."
S. S.	2021-09-19T14:12:49Z	Salaamun alaikum Dr Hany. Al Hamdulillah! A beautiful and consistent interpretation of Iblees/Jinn that has answered some doubts and inconsistencies that I have been living with for years. May Allah bless you and protect you and help you to complete your Mission.

Dri Ven	2021-09-19T11:12:41Z	A human is molded slowly by culture, interaction, the people around us. I dont think most of us are truly adults before we hit the 40's. A psychopath is a psychopath from birth and little other than threats of severe violence will make them pretend to be socialized. You cannot, unlike with humans, speak to their 'better nature' because their nature is a hidden one that we cannot understand at all. What does complete lack of empathy and remorse feel like? Is it cold? Warm? Fuzzy? Humans can worship their ego/lowest desires and behave like a psychopath and even become cold to their own actions as Allah strengthens that persons disbelief but there is always a way out on offer. A psychopath can behave orderly and therefore can chose to follow the straight path, for whatever reasons they have. Which would make them 'guided' anyway, right?
Uzair Sserunkuuma	2021-09-19T11:02:13Z	thanks Dr. Hope your are well may Allah give you protection.
