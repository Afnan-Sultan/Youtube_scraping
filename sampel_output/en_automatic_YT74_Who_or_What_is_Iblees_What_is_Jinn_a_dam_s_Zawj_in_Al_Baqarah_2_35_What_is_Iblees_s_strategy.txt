00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.480
this segment is perhaps the most

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.400
important segment on this channel so far

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.320
i ask you that you really pay close

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.519
attention to it and that you take the

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.719
time to focus and to discard all other

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.200
distractions

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.200
and allow

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.000
this segment will change your life and

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:37.280
the life of everyone around you and this

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.920
is no exaggeration i ask you that if you

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.960
are involved in any way in educating

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.239
others in the education industry if you

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.200
are a parent or if you ever hope to be a

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.440
parent you cannot afford to miss any

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.320
part of this segment

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.960
because this segment discloses some of

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.000
the quranic truths about iblees

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.079
iblees will be fighting you every second

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.799
in this segment and therefore the

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.880
primary task for iblis is to get you to

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.040
stop watching in the middle of the

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.880
segment and to get you to stop

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.600
benefiting and learning from this

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.080
segment i ask you to take it seriously

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.080
please we have a lot of important

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.400
material to cover and i hope you stick

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.240
with us all the way to the end so this

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.320
segment is called who or what is iblees

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.520
we will cover significant information

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.079
about the jinn and we will also cover

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.920
information about adams zouge in

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:37.520
al-baqarah ayah 35. this segment is part

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.560
2.8

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.520
in the series called why no stories

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.439
equal the quran in which we discuss how

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:50.079
to extract abrahamic locution from zikr

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.479
important information from the stories

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:54.640
and the parables in the quran in this

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.600
segment we will be continuing the story

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.960
of adam in surah al-baqarah al-baqarah

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.439
34 and 35 are the two ayat that we will

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.680
really dive into it will take us a

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.800
little bit of time as you see on the

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.520
length of this video adam and his house

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.040
in

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.200
235 will be discussed also in detail

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.800
we will talk about the nature of iblis

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.680
his disposition

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.800
and his strategy how he works to

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.280
misguide us and mislead us away from the

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.360
path to allah

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.160
we will discuss jinn

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.239
and their nature we will also talk about

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:37.120
the type of relationship between iblees

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:39.760
and allah we have more than 16 questions

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.000
specific questions about adam and

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.480
ebleese that we will be answering in

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.400
this video and i hope you stay with us

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.400
all the way to the end because at the

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.480
very end there's a very practical

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.560
conclusion that i hope you do not miss

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.360
in prior segments i've asked you to

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.480
abandon all that you thought you knew

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.040
about adam in order to understand the

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.159
concepts in this segment we will discuss

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.800
iblis i ask you to discard all that you

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:11.040
thought you knew about iblis before you

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.360
watch this segment this segment is going

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.400
to radically change a lot of the

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.560
concepts that we were taught as muslims

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.360
in our early childhood in our

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.560
communities in our families you will see

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.200
for yourself the quran represents iblis

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.560
in a totally different way than what we

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.879
were told we may not answer all of your

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.000
questions in this segment but inshallah

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:38.640
we will discuss more questions in future

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.959
segments inshaallah very soon we assume

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.799
that you understand that this is part of

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.040
a series and therefore i ask you to

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.680
watch the videos in the rest of the

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.360
series before this one so this is part

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.319
2.8 there are eight parts that preceded

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.799
it i ask you that you do not start with

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:59.680
this video if this is your first

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:02.159
exposure to this series you really need

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.400
to enter your cup and we keep talking

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:06.319
about this that means you need to forget

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.879
all you thought you knew when you

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.200
approached the quran

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:13.680
allah teaches us from the quran in ways

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.639
that are unique to the quran and

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.040
concepts that are original in the quran

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:23.759
and therefore we have to allow ourselves

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:25.759
to receive from allah using the quran

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:28.160
this is an academic presentation it's

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:30.800
not for entertainment purposes so don't

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.600
expect it to be short don't expect it to

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:37.440
be simple don't expect your mind to be

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.919
operating at less than 50 or 80 percent

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.160
of its capacity so that you can really

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.639
receive the concepts and the information

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.800
in this video but if you do i promise

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:49.600
you you will get to learn about the

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.840
really important organic quranic

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.520
methodology the methodology that is

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.400
deposited by allah in the quran which we

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:01.039
use and we also use a concept called

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.960
nested interpretation and the concept of

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:04.880
the abrahamic locution

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.039
if you do all of this and you watch the

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.120
segment till the end i promise you

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:12.160
you're going to have a sense of

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.680
happiness a sense of satisfaction you

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:18.320
have never felt before i promise this if

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.639
you follow these instructions after the

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.199
first half of this segment all the

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.600
questions will become simple i promise

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:27.680
and the answers will be very easy to

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.240
understand we have so many questions

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.840
that we need to address about iblis in

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.080
this segment we will deal with the

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.600
following questions in future segments

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.720
we will continue with this list of

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:42.240
questions and deal with more questions

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:45.680
so we have a total of 16 questions first

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:48.160
question is is iblees an angel or a jinn

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.919
is there ambiguity in the quran with

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.800
this regard

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:55.520
why did the police refuse to do sujud

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.639
was ableist created from fire

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.880
what is iblis's current strategy against

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:03.840
you personally against every single

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:07.440
person what does it mean to say that

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:11.840
iblis is regime why was iblees told by

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.840
allah upon you shall be my curse

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:18.000
in a couple of different ayat who is

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.479
adam zhao specifically in this segment

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.759
we will deal with ayah 35

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:27.039
of surat al-baqarah if iblees was a jinn

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:29.600
what is a jinn isn't the belief in jinn

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:32.720
part of our akhida and therefore we have

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:36.080
to really understand what this means why

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:39.280
did bliss not die why doesn't he die

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:42.080
how many ableises are there

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.280
does iblis have ethereal progeny or

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.360
descendants

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.000
as some people claim

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.720
why did allah create a iblis

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.759
how come iblees conversed with allah

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:56.880
why was iblees personified in the quran

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:59.039
is iblis an evil opponent to allah all

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.479
of these questions and more insha allah

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:03.280
we will deal with them in this segment

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:05.520
so as you see this is a really packed

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.520
segment and i hope that you will benefit

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.599
from this as much as possible in the

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.880
future segments we will deal with more

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:15.599
questions such as the nature of shaitaan

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:18.880
we will talk about jahannam the gateways

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:21.759
to jahannam ways to overcome iblis and

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:25.199
shaitaan that are provided for us in the

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:26.960
quran allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala told us

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:30.160
so many different things that we need to

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.199
learn about our primary foe our primary

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.520
enemy

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:36.479
we remind you that we do not teach the

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:39.599
corrupted torah or the injeel or any

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:43.039
other claims made by any other group of

00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:45.759
people the quran is not torah 2.0 and

00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:48.000
therefore we focus on the quran on this

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:50.960
channel we really want to just

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.199
understand matters from within the quran

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.440
directly from allah

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:58.879
i remind you that all the other

00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:00.240
narrations hadith claims

00:07:58.879 --> 00:08:01.919
stories

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.479
whatever fiction

00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:06.800
may be told about this topic are

00:08:04.479 --> 00:08:09.280
absolutely irrelevant when we discuss

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.319
things from within the quran the ayah

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.680
from

00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:14.319
that we've talked about many times

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:17.680
before you can read it in arabic had he

00:08:14.319 --> 00:08:20.479
muhammad sallam added any declaration on

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.960
top of our declarations meaning added

00:08:20.479 --> 00:08:25.199
details to anything that we talked about

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.479
and discussed and presented in the quran

00:08:25.199 --> 00:08:28.479
allah is speaking

00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:30.720
we would have punished him and then we

00:08:28.479 --> 00:08:32.719
would have severed his life vein for

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:36.080
then none of you would have been a

00:08:32.719 --> 00:08:39.039
shield protecting him we only accept the

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:41.120
narrations that agree with the quran not

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:43.760
the other way around we don't bring the

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.839
narration assuming it is sahih or

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.480
whatever label you want to throw on it

00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:50.560
and then impose it over the quran that

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.640
does not work on this channel it does

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:56.320
not work based on the quranic

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:58.480
methodology that allah gave us

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.240
these are a bunch of reminders i'm going

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.560
to put them up on the screen for just

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.720
couple of seconds so you can read them

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.640
pause the video if you need to but

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:09.519
please read these things these are

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:11.360
essential background information some of

00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:13.760
you who have been diligent in watching

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:16.080
the videos on this channel know this

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:18.160
information very well but some of you

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.399
who may be new you need to really

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.959
understand this concept of nebi and

00:09:20.399 --> 00:09:25.600
rasul adam and khalifa and the

00:09:22.959 --> 00:09:28.480
difference between them etc

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:31.040
very well so now we move to the concept

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.800
of adam and iblees we will present an

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.760
introduction and then we will start

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.839
diving into the questions one at a time

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.560
we will make it really fast to keep this

00:09:37.839 --> 00:09:42.880
video short and sweet but it is really

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:45.519
important that you pause the video you

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:47.600
think you reflect and then you take

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:49.839
notes if you have some questions and if

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:52.640
they're not addressed or answered by the

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:55.360
end of this video please include them in

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:57.680
some respectful comment or send me an

00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:00.880
email the email you'll find it in the

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:05.040
description box of the video aya 34 from

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.040
surah al-baqarah allah

00:10:12.399 --> 00:10:17.360
and when we said to the angels prostrate

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.920
in submission to adam and thus they

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:23.360
prostrated in submission except ableis

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.880
who did not submit he refused and was

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.600
conceited

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:29.200
and was among the rejecters i want to

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.760
draw your attention to the word

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:34.160
conceited which we use frequently in

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:37.040
this segment it does not mean simply

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:40.560
arrogant it is not thinking well or

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:43.920
highly or heartily of oneself in other

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:46.640
words someone who specifically believes

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:49.040
all of his opinions are the most valued

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:52.640
opinion the most correct opinion is

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.760
tikbar istikbar we talked about this in

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.000
the video

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:58.800
we talked about this in several videos

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.480
before please refer to other videos to

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:03.040
really get into the details of this

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:04.640
concept and we said that the meaning of

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:07.279
allahu akbar

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:10.000
allah is the one with the most correct

00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:13.120
opinion of anyone there are no more

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.839
correct opinions than the information

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:19.279
that we receive from allah ayah number

00:11:15.839 --> 00:11:22.279
11 from surah 7

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:22.279
says

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:41.120
and then gave you your

00:11:37.839 --> 00:11:44.399
physical form again plural

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:47.120
and then later summa said to the angels

00:11:44.399 --> 00:11:49.120
prostrate in submission to adam and thus

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.959
they prostrated in submission except

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:54.079
iblees who did not submit

00:11:50.959 --> 00:11:56.079
he was not of those who prostrate in

00:11:54.079 --> 00:11:57.600
submission please pay attention to this

00:11:56.079 --> 00:11:58.800
one

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.600
mean

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:04.480
he was not of those who prostrate in

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:07.120
submission not who prostrated in

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:09.839
submission this is very critical because

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:12.720
in several different areas allah gives

00:12:09.839 --> 00:12:15.120
us different variations of the same fact

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:17.920
and then draws your attention

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:20.399
to the multiple nuances of the meanings

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:22.560
that allah is trying to convey

00:12:20.399 --> 00:12:25.040
also please pay attention to the fact

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:28.079
that this is plural we have created you

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:30.959
multiple many of you and then sawarna

00:12:28.079 --> 00:12:34.000
kum many of you we gave you their

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:37.200
physical form and then we told the

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.639
angels to bow down or prostrate in

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:42.320
submission to adam and therefore adam

00:12:40.639 --> 00:12:44.639
came after

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.639
many were already in place and this is

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:49.200
exactly what we've been saying in the

00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:53.200
last two segments which are the

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:59.200
part 2.6 and point seven of this series

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:59.200
in surah 17 ayah 61 allah says

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:10.160
and then we said to the angels prostrate

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:12.720
and submission to adam and thus they

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:15.760
prostrated in submission except iblis

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:18.800
who did not submit he said after he was

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:21.760
questioned by allah shall i prostrate in

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:24.480
submission to whom you created out of

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:26.639
moldable clay we're gonna see a little

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:30.079
bit more detailed definition of the

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:32.079
concept of clean moldable clay so just

00:13:30.079 --> 00:13:33.680
be patient and stay with us insha'allah

00:13:32.079 --> 00:13:37.519
you will learn a little bit more about

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:39.040
this concept in ayah 1 16 of surah surah

00:13:37.519 --> 00:13:41.279
20

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.279
says

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.279
and then when we said to the angels

00:13:47.279 --> 00:13:51.760
prostrate and submission to adam and

00:13:49.279 --> 00:13:54.560
thus they prostrated in submission

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:58.079
except eblis who did not submit he

00:13:54.560 --> 00:14:00.000
refused this was ayah 1 16 of surat

00:13:58.079 --> 00:14:03.680
surah number 20.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.800
and then finally for this part in a 31

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:09.120
of surah 15

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.120
allah says

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:20.399
and thus the angels prostrated in

00:14:16.959 --> 00:14:21.839
submission all of them all together this

00:14:20.399 --> 00:14:24.160
is very important

00:14:21.839 --> 00:14:27.519
except the police who did not submit he

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:30.160
refused to be with those who prostrate

00:14:27.519 --> 00:14:33.440
in submission and this brings us to the

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:36.560
very first question is iblis an angel or

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:38.800
a jinn is there ambiguity in the quran

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:43.440
with this regard of course we just saw

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:45.760
the ayah from surah al-hijr which says

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:48.320
all of them all of the angels prostrated

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:50.560
that means iblees was not part of the

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:54.000
angels this is very clear this is also

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:56.480
confirmed in ayah 74 of surah 38 surah

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.480
assad

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:04.880
and thus the angels prostrated in

00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:07.680
submission all of them all of them none

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:11.600
of them were left out all together none

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:14.480
of them is left behind etc except abilis

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:17.279
did not prostrate he was conceited and

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:20.160
he was among rejecters therefore here

00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:23.199
there's a valid question why is allah

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:26.000
using the word or the preposition illa

00:15:23.199 --> 00:15:27.839
which is an exception preposition just

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.680
be patient we're going to see it in just

00:15:27.839 --> 00:15:32.320
a couple of minutes it's right here on

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:36.399
the same page inshaallah so now we move

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:36.399
to af50 of surah al qaeda

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:41.720
adam

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.720
lisa

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:48.720
and when we said to the angels prostrate

00:15:45.839 --> 00:15:51.360
in submission to adam and thus they did

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:54.240
prostrate in submission except that

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:57.360
iblees who did not submit was of the

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:59.360
jinn very clear can mean

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:02.399
we're going to see a lot more detail

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:05.519
about this area allah does not leave

00:16:02.399 --> 00:16:08.480
this to be the only area where allah

00:16:05.519 --> 00:16:12.800
discusses the nature of iblis but

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:16.079
clearly allah gave us this ayah 50 of

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:19.199
surah 18 and he told us he was of the

00:16:16.079 --> 00:16:21.600
jinn and here he told us that all of the

00:16:19.199 --> 00:16:24.320
angels prostrated none of them were left

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:27.040
out so clearly iblis is not part of the

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:29.680
angels we don't believe that he was a

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:32.320
fallen angel that he was in charge of

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:36.160
some lower heaven or some part of the

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:38.720
dominion of allah which is by the way in

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:41.920
some of the books of tafsir including

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:44.399
the most famous book of tafsir at tabari

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:46.800
so we have to be really careful and

00:16:44.399 --> 00:16:48.959
really honest with ourselves this is

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:51.759
very clearly against what the quran

00:16:48.959 --> 00:16:54.720
itself says by the way there are some

00:16:51.759 --> 00:16:57.600
other books of tafsir that says well the

00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:00.160
jinn is only a group from among the

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.920
angels no they're not because the quran

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.559
clearly says

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:06.799
all of them all of the angels prostrated

00:17:04.559 --> 00:17:10.000
therefore the jinn if they are a part of

00:17:06.799 --> 00:17:12.319
the angels could not be an acceptable

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.480
interpretation and therefore

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:17.360
there is no ambiguity in the quran it's

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:21.120
very clear in arabic the preposition

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:24.319
illa allah which is right here ille

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:27.520
which which occurs as we saw in almost

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:30.240
all of the yet does not require that

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:33.039
what is before it and what is after it

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:36.240
are of the same genre what do you mean

00:17:33.039 --> 00:17:38.640
well the preposition illa applies to the

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.640
verb

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:46.320
except iblis who did not prostrate not

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:49.039
except iblis who was not part of the

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:52.400
angels and therefore allah told the

00:17:49.039 --> 00:17:54.880
angels and through the angels all of

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:57.440
creation all of the creatures who

00:17:54.880 --> 00:18:01.600
received the scriptures from the angels

00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:04.280
as we discussed in ayah 30 31 32 in the

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:06.960
prior segments through the angels

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:09.760
allah is delivering the scripture and

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:12.240
therefore all of the other creatures are

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.840
receiving this information that's what

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.840
it

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:18.640
means that means in the scripture and

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:21.520
therefore iblees received this

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:24.960
information through the scripture was he

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:27.440
commanded to prostrate in submission we

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:30.559
will see insha allah just be patient so

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:32.880
therefore here it's very clear iblis is

00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:35.360
of the jinn he's not of the angels

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.520
there's no confusion or ambiguity in the

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:39.600
quran whatsoever

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:42.720
i want to draw your attention now to

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:43.919
this phenomenal research work that was

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:47.679
done by

00:18:43.919 --> 00:18:47.679
sheikh abdul halek

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:58.559
at azhar who died in

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:59.600
1982 i believe so he spent 25 years of

00:18:58.559 --> 00:19:02.480
his life

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:05.760
developing this encyclopedia concordance

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:07.919
of the style of the quran not the terms

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:11.039
and vocabulary of the quran there are

00:19:07.919 --> 00:19:13.919
other people who have done that

00:19:11.039 --> 00:19:17.840
worked on this 11 volume

00:19:13.919 --> 00:19:20.960
series that detail how the quran uses

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:23.600
all sorts of prepositions and stylistic

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:26.240
nuances and expressions that are unique

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:28.880
to the quran and he put them in

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:31.600
different indexes and he created a

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:34.000
really superb encyclopedia that is

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:36.320
absolutely indispensable for any

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.880
researcher who's working in this area

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:41.840
and then as you see you see that i have

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:44.400
it prominently in my book collection

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:46.880
because it is so important to me i rely

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:49.520
on it significantly and i constantly

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:52.559
refer to it in this video segment in sha

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:54.559
allah we will refer to this work and

00:19:52.559 --> 00:19:56.960
this is extremely important for my

00:19:54.559 --> 00:19:59.360
arabic speaking brothers and sisters who

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:02.320
are always skeptical about the type of

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:04.799
research that we present a lot of work

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:07.440
that has been done by this scholar who

00:20:04.799 --> 00:20:10.480
by the way received a very famous

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:11.520
international prize called the king

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:14.640
faisal

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:17.360
prize for advanced research in islamic

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:20.320
studies in 1962

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:22.880
this scholar has produced amazing work

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:26.159
he is referred to by many many different

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:29.200
people as the siba way or better than

00:20:26.159 --> 00:20:31.520
siba way in the 20th century so this

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:35.440
work is extremely important because he

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:37.520
is a highly specialized professor in the

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:40.000
linguistics of the arabic language

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:42.400
please refer to this work if you have

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.600
any questions as we shall see we will

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:47.520
refer to it as the set or the dirac book

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:50.799
so with this we move to question number

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:53.360
two why did iblees refuse to do sujud

00:20:50.799 --> 00:20:55.440
why did iblees refuse to prostrate in

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:58.000
submission and by the way sujud in the

00:20:55.440 --> 00:21:00.159
quran does not necessarily mean the

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.320
physical bowing down and putting the

00:21:00.159 --> 00:21:05.120
forehead on the ground or any of that

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:07.600
stuff sometimes it does but not all the

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:12.240
time the general meaning of the word

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:16.000
sujud refers to submission to willingly

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:19.120
give up one's own opinion or one's own

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.600
will or choice in favor of a better one

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:24.559
and therefore when allah talks about the

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:27.039
angels prostrating it is not really

00:21:24.559 --> 00:21:29.360
referring to the physical prostration

00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:31.679
when we talked about the story of yusuf

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:34.799
and we talked about him seeing the

00:21:31.679 --> 00:21:38.159
kowkeb or the kawakib prostrating in a

00:21:34.799 --> 00:21:41.360
dream we asked how do you see

00:21:38.159 --> 00:21:44.080
prostrating planets and we said this

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:46.559
cannot possibly be an interpretation of

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:49.280
a dream as we discussed it in the video

00:21:46.559 --> 00:21:50.120
that's labeled what was yusuf's dream

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:54.000
here

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:54.000
allah is using the verb

00:21:55.360 --> 00:22:00.480
prostrate in submission allah is using

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:03.760
the verb this is not part of a dream it

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:06.000
has no physical indication whatsoever

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:08.559
and therefore here it means something

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:13.799
very clearly that has nothing to do with

00:22:08.559 --> 00:22:13.799
the physical prostration so what is

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:25.760
so when we said to the angels prostrate

00:22:23.919 --> 00:22:27.919
in submission to adam and thus they

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:30.159
prostrated in submission except iblis

00:22:27.919 --> 00:22:33.360
who did not submit as we saw

00:22:30.159 --> 00:22:36.720
he was of the jinn and thus he was

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:40.039
inordinate meaning disobedient meaning

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:43.280
he strayed away from the commands from

00:22:40.039 --> 00:22:47.440
allah meaning he was rejecting the

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:50.240
orders in accordance with or because of

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:51.600
his lord's established arrangement

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:54.320
amr

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:57.760
established arrangement or the ordained

00:22:54.320 --> 00:23:00.960
organization the systemic existence of

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:02.159
everything in this universe that's amir

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:04.960
khan and

00:23:02.159 --> 00:23:08.400
from the command given by his lord and

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:12.000
therefore allah is telling us his lord's

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:14.559
established arrangement was for everyone

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.440
and everything to prostrate in

00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:21.200
submission to adam however

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:23.520
iblis did not did not do this he was

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:26.400
inordinate and we're going to see the

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:29.440
justification for this or why did at

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:31.360
least do this the key point here is that

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:34.640
the preposition an

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:37.520
translates to in accordance with or

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:39.760
because of and i know my arabic speaking

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:43.200
brothers and sisters are really confused

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:45.760
or objecting right now because this is

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:48.559
something that is not typical yes it is

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:51.039
not typical in the language of the arab

00:23:48.559 --> 00:23:53.360
poets but in the quran there are many

00:23:51.039 --> 00:23:56.480
examples and that's why i referred you

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:59.600
earlier to this book called dira set and

00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:04.159
i ask you to refer to it it is volume

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:06.960
number two page 170 to 173

00:24:04.159 --> 00:24:10.400
you will see a lot of details about this

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:13.600
analysis done by professor odaima may

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:17.760
allah be pleased with him for example in

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:17.760
ayah 52 of surah al-qaeda

00:24:18.159 --> 00:24:22.480
we talked about this story when we

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:25.679
discussed the fact that there is no

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:28.799
in the quran and i did not undertake to

00:24:25.679 --> 00:24:33.360
do it in accordance with my own command

00:24:28.799 --> 00:24:33.360
based on my own command so that was

00:24:34.799 --> 00:24:41.760
he does not express anything

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:41.760
in accordance with his own fancy han

00:24:45.279 --> 00:24:50.960
53 and we shall not abandon our deities

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:54.720
because of your claim because so as we

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:57.120
saw in accordance with or because is

00:24:54.720 --> 00:25:00.799
part of this meaning of the preposition

00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:04.720
and faith

00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:07.039
he was inordinate because of his lord's

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:09.520
established orders or commands or

00:25:07.039 --> 00:25:12.320
arrangement in other words this ayah is

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:14.720
clearly telling us or at least one

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:17.360
possible very legitimate interpretation

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:20.000
of this area in accordance with the real

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:22.320
authentic rules of grammar and

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.960
linguistics of arabic language as

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:27.360
demonstrated by this really extensive

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:29.200
research that was done by dr odaima it

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:32.720
is acceptable to say

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:35.480
iblis was inordinate not against allah's

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:39.440
will but because of the commands that

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:43.120
allah gave him specifically so his

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:46.640
lord's established arrangement included

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:48.960
that he disobeys specific instructions

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:52.720
that are given to the rest of creation

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:55.840
therefore iblis was given a disposition

00:25:52.720 --> 00:26:00.240
to refuse certain commands he was

00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:02.640
allowed he was required to be inordinate

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:05.520
to be disobedient to be

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:08.240
different than other creation he was

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:10.640
tasked with a special task in accordance

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:12.880
with his lord's established arrangement

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:15.120
i know you're surprised right now i know

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:16.880
you have not heard this before but this

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:19.120
is very clear in the quran and we're

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:21.360
going to see it more and more and i will

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:23.279
demonstrate it to you in half a dozen

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:25.440
different ayah just be patient and

00:26:23.279 --> 00:26:27.600
continue watching insha allah and i

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:30.480
promise you you're going to learn a lot

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:32.559
of new things here so therefore his

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:35.600
response was in accordance to the

00:26:32.559 --> 00:26:37.840
established arrangement by allah not

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:41.039
against it he was not supposed to

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:43.600
prostrate in blind submission this is

00:26:41.039 --> 00:26:45.039
part of his disposition therefore we're

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:47.919
going to see a little bit more about

00:26:45.039 --> 00:26:49.120
this and we're going to present more

00:26:47.919 --> 00:26:52.960
evidence

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:52.960
so in ayah 75 of

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:11.039
what prevented you from prostrating in

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:13.360
submission to what i have created with

00:27:11.039 --> 00:27:15.039
my own yadayya i'm going to leave it

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:17.039
like that right now because i really

00:27:15.039 --> 00:27:19.760
don't want to get into this topic this

00:27:17.039 --> 00:27:21.600
is a very hairy discussion that we will

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:24.720
have at a different time so for now

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:27.120
allah is talking about

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:28.640
it has been translated as hands and this

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:31.080
is the wrong translation i don't want to

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:34.159
get into more specifics right now so

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:36.720
allah continues are you being conceited

00:27:34.159 --> 00:27:39.440
or have you been exalted do you take

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:42.799
yourself as hardy as higher than anybody

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:45.039
else in surah al-araf number 12 allah

00:27:42.799 --> 00:27:45.039
says

00:28:18.559 --> 00:28:22.480
not to prostrate

00:28:20.159 --> 00:28:24.559
what prevented you so that you did not

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:26.720
prostrate this is a different structure

00:28:24.559 --> 00:28:29.039
of the sentence it is not the same

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:31.360
sentence it is not saying the same thing

00:28:29.039 --> 00:28:34.559
it cannot possibly be saying the same

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:36.480
thing because allah says

00:28:34.559 --> 00:28:38.080
and here he says

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:41.520
totally different proposition as a

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:44.559
matter of fact allah is two concatenated

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:47.039
propositions so therefore allah is

00:28:44.559 --> 00:28:49.200
pointing us to something very important

00:28:47.039 --> 00:28:51.679
so let's read the translation as it will

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:55.760
work out and we will demonstrate it he

00:28:51.679 --> 00:28:59.440
allah said to iblees what prevented you

00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:00.880
thus not prostrating in submission as i

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:03.000
commanded you

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:06.320
not to do so in other words

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.799
allah commanded him because of his

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:11.440
nature because of his disposition

00:29:08.799 --> 00:29:14.159
not to follow orders blindly and

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:16.720
therefore when allah gave him the

00:29:14.159 --> 00:29:19.440
command he did not have to follow them

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:20.240
and therefore he chose not to follow

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:23.679
them

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:26.399
and now allah is teaching us

00:29:23.679 --> 00:29:28.480
thus not prostrating in submission as i

00:29:26.399 --> 00:29:31.919
commanded you so the question here is

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:34.799
not why you did not prostrate allah is

00:29:31.919 --> 00:29:36.799
asking him explain if you understand

00:29:34.799 --> 00:29:40.000
your own justification

00:29:36.799 --> 00:29:41.679
for what prevented you from prostrating

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.159
and this is a different question it's

00:29:41.679 --> 00:29:47.039
not why you did not prostrate it is what

00:29:44.159 --> 00:29:49.360
prevented you there is something that

00:29:47.039 --> 00:29:52.399
iblis is going to talk about that will

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:55.679
tell us more details about his own

00:29:52.399 --> 00:29:59.760
disposition about his own nature his own

00:29:55.679 --> 00:30:02.320
ability to disobey commands from allah

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:05.520
so before we do this though i want to

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:09.440
focus on this preposition if and again

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:13.760
from the book the dirac volume 1

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:17.279
page 130 to 132 you will find a detailed

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:21.360
analysis of why this scholar dr odaiman

00:30:17.279 --> 00:30:24.480
says that eth is used for ta'al which

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:27.679
indicates justification most of the time

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:32.000
if indicates when but in some cases in

00:30:27.679 --> 00:30:34.000
the quran it also indicates causation or

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.720
justification and therefore when we

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.720
start in here

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:42.399
this is a justification allah is telling

00:30:40.159 --> 00:30:44.720
him what prevented you other than that

00:30:42.399 --> 00:30:48.000
what is in your nature that actually

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:51.279
prevents you from following commands

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:54.240
beyond the choice of not obeying the

00:30:51.279 --> 00:30:57.600
commands from allah i hope this is clear

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:59.760
so iblis said i am an application from

00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.760
him

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:05.600
now

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:07.440
has often been translated as i am better

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:10.080
than him and this is not necessarily

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:12.080
wrong but here we have a tough seal

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:14.799
remember tough seal the breaking up of

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:17.200
the syntactical structures in such a way

00:31:14.799 --> 00:31:20.480
to extract new meanings or different

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:20.480
meanings than we expected

00:31:21.279 --> 00:31:24.159
so in the area

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:33.840
applications or understanding of how to

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:37.919
apply the revelation from your lord min

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:40.080
rabbikum so here is the same thing

00:31:37.919 --> 00:31:43.120
i am an application or his own

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:46.320
understanding coming from him ah now we

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:48.559
understand so iblis is actually feeding

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:51.760
on our own understanding atleast is

00:31:48.559 --> 00:31:55.360
taking a cue from our own understanding

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:59.440
to apply his decisions or to make his

00:31:55.360 --> 00:32:00.399
choices allah is teaching us is

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:03.600
i have

00:32:00.399 --> 00:32:07.200
given you that command not to prostrate

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:10.720
why because i am an application from him

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:12.399
i follow his lead so now we start to get

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:15.039
an indication

00:32:12.399 --> 00:32:17.360
that there is a person involved kairon

00:32:15.039 --> 00:32:19.360
min who there is someone he's talking

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:21.360
about and we're going to see it in more

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:23.600
detail just be patient we're going to

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:26.000
see a lot more inshaallah but here's the

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:29.519
first hint that we just shared so he

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:32.080
continues you created me from fire his

00:32:29.519 --> 00:32:33.919
own man-made dim illumination in the

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:36.399
darkness i know this is a mouthful just

00:32:33.919 --> 00:32:38.480
be patient again a lot of details will

00:32:36.399 --> 00:32:40.559
be uncovered just be patient and stay

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:43.200
with us even if this sounds a little

00:32:40.559 --> 00:32:45.039
confusing i promise you in the second

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:47.519
half of the video it's going to get a

00:32:45.039 --> 00:32:50.480
lot easier and so many different things

00:32:47.519 --> 00:32:52.000
will become so clear and easy to

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:54.960
understand

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:58.000
so allah continues in talking about

00:32:54.960 --> 00:33:00.960
iblis he said iblee said you created me

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.279
from fire and you created him from clay

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:04.640
so we talked about clean before now

00:33:03.279 --> 00:33:06.480
we're going to detail it a little bit

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:09.279
more clean

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:12.799
moldable slow drying construction

00:33:09.279 --> 00:33:15.600
material why because that's clean to the

00:33:12.799 --> 00:33:16.640
ancient people when you talk about clean

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.480
those of you

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:21.840
who have gone those of you who have

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:24.240
visited old villages and ancient

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:28.000
cultures you understand that there are

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:31.919
houses that are constructed from clay

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.960
bricks clay blocks the clay is gathered

00:33:31.919 --> 00:33:37.679
from certain areas it is mixed with hay

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:40.480
it is mixed in certain proportions and

00:33:37.679 --> 00:33:42.799
then it's poured in special molds of

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:45.600
different sizes and then they're exposed

00:33:42.799 --> 00:33:47.840
to the sun for a certain time period and

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:50.799
then they're used in a certain way so

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:53.519
molding the clay is the process that

00:33:50.799 --> 00:33:57.279
we're talking about so a human being is

00:33:53.519 --> 00:34:00.559
molded but he gets molded slowly he gets

00:33:57.279 --> 00:34:04.799
molded in a deliberate manner it takes

00:34:00.559 --> 00:34:07.120
time and therefore allah says you humans

00:34:04.799 --> 00:34:10.159
are clean you're not fire

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:12.720
fire is something that burns quick

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:16.800
something that excites something that

00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:20.399
happens very fast clean takes time takes

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:23.919
precision takes deliberateness takes

00:34:20.399 --> 00:34:27.119
thinking and clean is used to build

00:34:23.919 --> 00:34:29.359
things whereas fire is used to destroy

00:34:27.119 --> 00:34:32.079
things so therefore now we start

00:34:29.359 --> 00:34:34.879
understanding iblis is talking about he

00:34:32.079 --> 00:34:37.520
is being created from fire of course

00:34:34.879 --> 00:34:40.079
this is metaphorical language this is a

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:42.720
special abrahamic locution that is not

00:34:40.079 --> 00:34:46.399
supposed to be understood in its most

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:49.280
direct form in its most physical form so

00:34:46.399 --> 00:34:51.359
the fire is his own man-made dim

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:53.440
illumination in the darkness he's

00:34:51.359 --> 00:34:55.119
talking about a human being now we're

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:57.200
starting to get the hint of what's going

00:34:55.119 --> 00:34:58.880
on with iblis so in answer to the

00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:01.359
question that we asked earlier why did

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:04.880
the police refuse to do sujood the

00:35:01.359 --> 00:35:07.119
answer is he was given a disposition in

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:10.000
accordance with his lord's established

00:35:07.119 --> 00:35:11.440
arrangement not against it and his

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.359
disposition

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:17.599
made him not prostrate because he acts

00:35:15.359 --> 00:35:19.040
based on the principles of the fire

00:35:17.599 --> 00:35:21.359
don't worry i'm going to give you more

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:23.599
details about the fire and the clay so

00:35:21.359 --> 00:35:27.040
just be patient but i'm starting to

00:35:23.599 --> 00:35:28.960
relay the information slowly one piece

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:31.119
at a time and we're unraveling the

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:33.040
horror very carefully if you're still

00:35:31.119 --> 00:35:37.280
not convinced i want you to reflect of

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:40.280
this area number 44 of surah al-israe

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:40.280
says

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:58.320
the seven layers of understanding and

00:35:53.040 --> 00:36:00.720
the scripture and yes in this case as s

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:03.839
could possibly be interpreted to mean

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:06.480
the physical layers of heaven and the

00:36:03.839 --> 00:36:09.119
physical earth that's underneath us but

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:11.920
in general i want to stay consistent in

00:36:09.119 --> 00:36:13.520
the translation and therefore i use the

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:16.720
seven layers of understanding in the

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:19.599
scripture as you see and all those who

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:19.599
follow their ways

00:36:21.599 --> 00:36:26.000
based on the preposition fee is not

00:36:23.599 --> 00:36:28.839
necessarily referring to a location so

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:32.000
for example at the end of surat al-ang

00:36:28.839 --> 00:36:32.000
allah says

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:40.160
those who strive in our ways or in

00:36:37.599 --> 00:36:42.480
accordance with our ways clearly this is

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:45.040
not a location reference it is not

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:47.960
something that refers to a location or

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:51.119
to content of something within something

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:53.920
allah says

00:36:51.119 --> 00:36:56.160
could be interpreted as those who follow

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:58.320
their ways which ways the ways of the

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:59.920
seven layers of understanding which

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:03.400
includes everything which includes

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:05.520
everything we were told by allah

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:07.839
scripture the basis for our

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:11.040
comprehension of everything if you are a

00:37:07.839 --> 00:37:14.160
believer everyone who is following these

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:16.960
things and engaging in the scripture and

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:18.480
engaging in anything of revelation from

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:22.400
allah

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:25.760
they conform to their dispositions as

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:28.640
established by allah they follow the

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:31.359
ways prescribed upon them they may have

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:35.200
choices within these ways but in general

00:37:31.359 --> 00:37:36.960
the ways are very well defined by allah

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:39.599
and there is nothing that does not

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:41.760
conform to his disposition in praise of

00:37:39.599 --> 00:37:41.760
him

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:56.000
but you comprehend not their conformance

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:58.160
indeed he is forbearing and amenable to

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.040
allow people to reconnect with him this

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:04.480
is ayah 44 from surah al-israh and

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:07.040
therefore we see that allah told us that

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:09.440
everything all creation everything that

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:11.839
is subject to the information in the

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:13.920
samawat and the information in the

00:38:11.839 --> 00:38:17.040
scripture which includes all of the

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:20.079
universe because allah allowed us to

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:22.079
have access to everything in the literal

00:38:20.079 --> 00:38:24.000
heavens and earth and therefore

00:38:22.079 --> 00:38:26.400
everything yusef

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:30.720
conformed to their dispositions as

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:33.440
provided for by allah and therefore at

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:35.359
least two yes absolutely iblees is a

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:38.079
creature of allah

00:38:35.359 --> 00:38:40.640
and therefore he has a disposition that

00:38:38.079 --> 00:38:44.240
was given to him by allah and this is a

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:47.119
significant important akida matter never

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:49.760
we are supposed to think that iblis is

00:38:47.119 --> 00:38:51.920
outside the realm or the dominion of

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:54.079
allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala everything in

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:57.920
the universe is under the dominion of

00:38:54.079 --> 00:39:00.800
allah our free will our freedom to

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:02.960
choose is under the disposition that

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:05.839
allah gave us and therefore when we talk

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:08.400
about iblis having a disposition to

00:39:05.839 --> 00:39:10.800
choose not to prostrate or to refuse a

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:14.720
certain command that is also part of the

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:17.040
disposition given to him by allah

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:18.960
why we will see a little bit later but

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:21.839
in sha allah this is very important

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:24.320
concept that is alpida essential for us

00:39:21.839 --> 00:39:27.520
to understand never are we supposed to

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:31.200
think that iblis is outside the dominion

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:35.280
and control of allah nothing nothing

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:37.520
happens without the permission of allah

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:39.920
because if you believe allah is a

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:41.760
creator and he is the controller of

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:43.920
everything in the universe nothing

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:46.000
happens without his permission and this

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:48.560
is a really essential component of

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.560
akhida that we share with you that is

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:52.880
really critical to understand the

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:55.200
concept of iblis and keep things in

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:58.240
perspective so the conclusion here is

00:39:55.200 --> 00:40:00.640
that iblis refused to prostrate in

00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:02.720
submission because part of his

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:04.240
disposition that was given to him by

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:06.240
allah

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:09.359
allows him that choice

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:12.240
because part of his disposition is to

00:40:09.359 --> 00:40:15.599
receive some information and make some

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:18.160
determination and then decide what he

00:40:15.599 --> 00:40:20.880
will do does that remind you of somebody

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:24.079
already we're getting closer and closer

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:26.240
to the reveal about iblis

00:40:24.079 --> 00:40:29.200
now we come to question number three was

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:31.760
iblis created from fire and the real

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:34.000
answer is not really from the physical

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:36.880
fire as we think about it or we were

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:39.359
taught to think about it iblis was

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:42.240
actually repurposed there was a point in

00:40:39.359 --> 00:40:44.720
time where iblees thought of himself as

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:47.599
being created from fire and then later

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:49.119
allah gave him new instructions and this

00:40:47.599 --> 00:40:51.440
is what we're going to talk about but

00:40:49.119 --> 00:40:54.079
before we dive into that we really need

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:56.240
to dive into the concept of the fire as

00:40:54.079 --> 00:40:58.880
defined in the quran and i know this is

00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:01.040
controversial just be patient and listen

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:03.520
and allow yourself to learn from the

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:05.920
quran allow your cup to be empty to

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:07.599
receive don't approach the quran

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:10.480
thinking you already know all the

00:41:07.599 --> 00:41:13.359
answers don't assume that what people

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:16.319
told you as a child or what people wrote

00:41:13.359 --> 00:41:18.880
in old books are correct let's review

00:41:16.319 --> 00:41:21.440
the quran and see if the quran is really

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:23.440
telling us something that confirms what

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:27.280
we thought was correct

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:29.520
so in ayah 17 of surah al-baqarah allah

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.520
says

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:50.319
few verses later he talks about baauda

00:41:47.599 --> 00:41:54.160
he's talking about the rejecters among

00:41:50.319 --> 00:41:57.920
bani israel allah is using this

00:41:54.160 --> 00:42:00.319
analogy this example their example is

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:03.200
like that of a person who sought to

00:42:00.319 --> 00:42:06.000
light a fire and when it illuminated

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:07.119
what was around him allah took away

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.720
their

00:42:07.119 --> 00:42:13.680
illumination allah took away their nur

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:15.920
the habballahu binuri him what is this

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:18.640
talking about as a matter of fact if you

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:20.880
believe that some hadith are possibly

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:23.200
correct there is a hadith

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:25.440
add the narration from the prophet

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:28.880
sallallahu sallam that says i am this

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:31.920
person who sought to light a fire is

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:35.119
tauka a new source of light in the

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:37.520
darkness of those people and when this

00:42:35.119 --> 00:42:40.880
new source of light became established

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:41.640
became clearly manifest to everyone to

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:45.200
see

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:49.040
allah took away any possible light they

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:51.760
have and that's why we say the scripture

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:54.480
of the quran eliminates everything that

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:56.880
came before it it doesn't matter if they

00:42:54.480 --> 00:43:00.079
have some parts of the scripture as they

00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:03.520
claim or some possibly valid portions of

00:43:00.079 --> 00:43:06.000
the torah or possibly valid correct

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:07.280
aspects of the injeel it doesn't matter

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.440
this area

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:12.240
eliminates everything that came before

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:15.040
it they had no illumination left

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:18.480
whatsoever from their sources outside

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:21.119
the quran allah is clearly telling us

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:24.160
when the quran became the new light in

00:43:21.119 --> 00:43:26.400
the darkness there is nothing else that

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:29.760
was left by allah

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:29.760
as a source of illumination

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:35.599
everything they had is taken away by

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:35.599
allah subhanahu wa ta'ala

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:43.440
why because they rejected the only light

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:46.560
that was given by allah to be valid from

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:48.480
that point forward so allah took away

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:50.079
their illumination and left them in

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:53.119
their darknesses

00:43:50.079 --> 00:43:55.760
unable to see so i hope this is clear so

00:43:53.119 --> 00:43:59.040
the concept of the fire and the night

00:43:55.760 --> 00:44:02.000
and the lumad darknesses is all related

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:04.960
around this concept this metaphorical

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:09.119
representation this symbolism we need to

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:12.319
think about how allah uses the word fire

00:44:09.119 --> 00:44:14.560
in this analogy and through the concept

00:44:12.319 --> 00:44:17.599
of nested interpretation as we did with

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:19.640
calcab now we start applying it in many

00:44:17.599 --> 00:44:23.839
different places in the quran so when

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:23.839
allah tells us

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:30.480
this is what he's talking about he's

00:44:28.079 --> 00:44:33.119
talking about the man-made dim

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:33.920
illumination in the darkness

00:44:33.119 --> 00:44:37.760
when

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:40.560
before the quran before the quran nar

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:42.640
used to give illumination when the quran

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:45.200
became established and manifest to

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:48.160
everyone and accessible to everyone it

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:50.960
became the only remaining source of

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:53.520
divine illumination everything else was

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:56.800
taken away by allah what does that mean

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:59.359
taken away allah does not allow you to

00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:02.319
benefit from it in any way shape or form

00:44:59.359 --> 00:45:04.480
you're not authorized to use it to claim

00:45:02.319 --> 00:45:07.040
that it is a source of illumination

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:08.640
is this arrogant of you dr hani no it's

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:11.040
not because this is what the quran is

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:13.839
clearly telling us and if you don't

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:15.680
believe the quran alone there is a clear

00:45:13.839 --> 00:45:18.240
hadith that talks about this where the

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:20.640
prophet sallallahu assalam says i am the

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:23.280
one who is

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:25.359
who sought to light a fire so regardless

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:28.640
of what you believe you cannot dismiss

00:45:25.359 --> 00:45:30.960
this area and say parts of the torah or

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:33.200
parts of the injeel are still valid or

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:35.760
as some of our brothers from different

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:38.160
sects of muslims want to convince us

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:40.880
that the whole torah is still valid that

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:43.680
the whole injeel is still valid and thus

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:46.240
eliminating at least a couple of dozen

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:48.640
ayat in the quran that clearly tell us

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:50.800
so this is one more ayah that clearly

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:55.920
talks about this so allah subhanahu wa

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:55.920
ta'ala tells us in ayah 75 from surat

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.079
and testament

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.319
what prevented you from prostrating and

00:46:04.079 --> 00:46:08.880
submission to what i have created with

00:46:06.319 --> 00:46:11.280
my own your day are you being conceited

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:14.960
or have you been exalted

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:14.960
he replied kaala and

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:22.960
as we saw a little earlier iblis said no

00:46:19.359 --> 00:46:25.440
my lord i am an application from him

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:27.839
derived from his understanding or

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:30.560
valtteri

00:46:27.839 --> 00:46:33.359
the gig is up now you understand what's

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:34.400
going on so iblis is actually talking

00:46:33.359 --> 00:46:37.599
about

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:39.760
guiding or misguiding people

00:46:37.599 --> 00:46:42.560
in accordance to their own

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:42.560
vel tension

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:49.599
sourced from him based on the

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:53.599
information within him based on the

00:46:49.599 --> 00:46:55.599
understanding that he has remember iblis

00:46:53.599 --> 00:46:57.440
does not work in the abstract he doesn't

00:46:55.599 --> 00:46:59.520
work against walls he doesn't work

00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:02.079
against the trees he doesn't work

00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:05.520
against the rocks he works against human

00:47:02.079 --> 00:47:08.560
beings he refuses to prostrate to adam

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:11.359
and his followers and therefore when

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:13.599
he's talking about min who the one he

00:47:11.359 --> 00:47:16.240
did not prostrate to he's talking about

00:47:13.599 --> 00:47:18.880
adam therefore he's talking about

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:20.559
something within adam the valtteri that

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:22.480
we keep talking about throughout these

00:47:20.559 --> 00:47:25.119
videos in this channel

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:28.800
you created me meaning you provided me

00:47:25.119 --> 00:47:32.400
the spiritual intellectual disposition

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:35.920
from fire or based on the concept of

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:37.280
fire i.e his own man-made dim

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:40.079
illumination

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:42.640
in the darkness when it was there

00:47:40.079 --> 00:47:45.440
before the scripture remember this

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:47.839
example from surah al-baqarah talks

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:50.559
about a time before the quran and

00:47:47.839 --> 00:47:54.079
therefore this concept of fire in the

00:47:50.559 --> 00:47:56.160
night is a concept before the quran this

00:47:54.079 --> 00:47:58.160
is going to be really important because

00:47:56.160 --> 00:48:00.319
we're going to discuss it in more detail

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:02.880
and you created him provided him the

00:48:00.319 --> 00:48:06.559
spiritual intellectual disposition

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:08.640
similar to clay mountain moldable slow

00:48:06.559 --> 00:48:10.720
drying construction material i think the

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:13.520
picture is very clear right now we're

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:15.920
becoming a lot more familiar with what's

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:15.920
going on

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:20.400
this is a continuation of the same surah

00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:23.359
ayah 77

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:24.480
he says you come out from it i.e from

00:48:23.359 --> 00:48:27.680
the fire

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:30.880
and thus you are tasked with being an

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:33.760
insider to banishment from my guidance

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:35.280
ooh regime i thought regime is someone

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:36.960
who is kicked out

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:40.160
yes possibly

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:43.680
but according to the linguistic analysis

00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:43.680
of the morpheme

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:50.000
it means one of two things either

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:53.440
being the object of the verb

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:56.000
or being the subject

00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:59.119
so there are many words in the quran

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.720
that follow the morpheme

00:48:59.119 --> 00:49:03.720
like amin

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:03.720
like

00:49:03.839 --> 00:49:11.680
all of these terms are following the

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:15.839
morpheme regime regime is actually

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:19.520
so therefore allah is tasking iblis with

00:49:15.839 --> 00:49:22.800
becoming the insider to banishment the

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:25.200
insider to be kicked out remember rajama

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:27.440
is to be kicked out or driven out or

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:32.160
cast out of a certain

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:35.119
position or station or location so allah

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:35.119
is telling iblees

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:42.559
now you are assigned the responsibility

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:45.280
of banishing from my guidance which

00:49:42.559 --> 00:49:49.520
guidance from the quran why because now

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:52.400
the quran is a new event he used to be

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:54.400
working on the basis of light the dim

00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:58.040
light in the middle of darknesses in the

00:49:54.400 --> 00:50:01.839
absence of scriptures and with the quran

00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:03.359
allah has provided a full complete

00:50:01.839 --> 00:50:05.920
unalterated

00:50:03.359 --> 00:50:08.720
scripture to mankind so now iblees does

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:11.040
not work only on the principles of the

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:13.760
fire before the scripture now he's

00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:16.400
assigned a new responsibility

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:18.720
come out from the old responsibility

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:21.440
from the principles or the basis of

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:24.400
operation that is in accordance with the

00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:27.680
concept of fire and now you are tasked

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:29.359
with being an insider to banishment from

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:32.640
my guidance from

00:50:29.359 --> 00:50:35.520
the new scripture and upon you meaning

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:38.880
upon your way shall be my curse until

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:41.359
the day of deen wa in alaika

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:43.680
eliyah this is an important question

00:50:41.359 --> 00:50:46.040
that we will deal with in a few minutes

00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:49.599
but just for now we need to say that

00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:49.599
allah is saying

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:56.319
as we see in here in this side note

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:59.520
alaika is often used to indicate onus or

00:50:56.319 --> 00:51:01.599
responsibility or way in other words

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:05.200
your way is

00:51:01.599 --> 00:51:07.920
the way to lana lana again has been

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:10.960
translated as curse but the arabic word

00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:11.760
lana as used in the quran represents to

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:15.119
be

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:18.480
cast away or deprived of the guidance

00:51:15.119 --> 00:51:20.880
from allah so upon you

00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:24.319
is the responsibility

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:26.559
of driving people away from the divine

00:51:24.319 --> 00:51:27.760
guidance ah now we understand what

00:51:26.559 --> 00:51:30.480
regime is

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:33.440
regime means the one who incites to

00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:34.880
banishment from the divine guidance

00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:37.280
and upon

00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:40.400
his shoulders at least

00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:42.960
is the responsibility of moving people

00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:44.800
away from the divine guidance now we

00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:48.079
understand the disposition that allah

00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:49.359
gave him so allah gave us the commands

00:51:48.079 --> 00:51:52.720
in the scripture

00:51:49.359 --> 00:51:55.760
and also provided us an enemy

00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:57.760
who actually works against the commands

00:51:55.760 --> 00:52:01.359
by allah

00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:04.800
and this lana or this casting away from

00:52:01.359 --> 00:52:07.920
divine guidance shall remain until the

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:10.480
day of adeen i am going to resist the

00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:13.200
urge to translate this as judgment day

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:16.319
it is not remember the translators and

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:18.880
the mufassirun combined all sorts of yao

00:52:16.319 --> 00:52:18.880
mudin

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:23.119
this and that every other word they

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:26.240
didn't understand they lumped them as

00:52:23.119 --> 00:52:29.040
judgment day not true allah

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:31.520
does not allow synonymy in the quran and

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:33.760
therefore if allah wanted to combine

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:37.599
multiple words into a single meaning he

00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:41.760
could have done that so when allah says

00:52:37.599 --> 00:52:43.920
it means one thing when allah says

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:45.520
it means something else they may point

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:48.480
to the same thing but there are some

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:50.240
detailed nuances in meaning that we need

00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:52.480
to take care of that we need to pay

00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:55.760
attention to and therefore i will leave

00:52:52.480 --> 00:53:01.440
it right now the day of deen

00:52:55.760 --> 00:53:01.440
we continue in ayah 79 allah

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:09.839
my lord grant me a stay to continue in

00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:12.400
the fire until the day they are

00:53:09.839 --> 00:53:14.960
revivified meaning when they become

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:17.200
alive again engaging the scripture

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:19.520
remember we're talking about after the

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:23.680
fire this is an event after the fire

00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:25.920
allah told him okay you were to operate

00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:28.640
in the absence of the scripture in the

00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:31.680
premises of the fire or in the context

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:34.000
of people being illuminated by man-made

00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:38.079
fire but now there's a scripture and

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:38.079
therefore now you have a task

00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:44.960
come out from the fire come out from the

00:53:42.559 --> 00:53:46.960
stage where you operated based on the

00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:50.480
principles of fire and now you have a

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:51.599
new task upon you is the responsibility

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:52.400
the onus

00:53:51.599 --> 00:53:55.359
to

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:58.079
curse people meaning to drive them to

00:53:55.359 --> 00:54:00.079
being deprived of the divine guidance

00:53:58.079 --> 00:54:02.880
until the day of deen

00:54:00.079 --> 00:54:06.079
and iblees responded grant me until the

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:08.319
day they are revivified when they become

00:54:06.079 --> 00:54:10.960
alive using the scripture of course

00:54:08.319 --> 00:54:14.640
that's what it means allah continues in

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:17.599
ayah 80 of the same surah surah assad he

00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:20.319
allah said you are among those granted a

00:54:17.599 --> 00:54:22.000
stay and this explains a question that a

00:54:20.319 --> 00:54:24.480
lot of scholars have not been able to

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:27.760
resolve why did allah

00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:30.319
agree to the request by ibis if he was

00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:32.400
an opponent of allah of course he was

00:54:30.319 --> 00:54:35.280
not an opponent of allah he was

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:37.920
following the disposition that allah

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:40.000
granted him and gave him and then he

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:42.160
asked allah

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:45.920
to grant him a stay

00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:48.240
meaning a time period to execute what

00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:51.599
he's tasked with which is being an

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:54.079
insider to banishment and upon him shall

00:54:51.599 --> 00:54:55.040
be the responsibility of the curse until

00:54:54.079 --> 00:54:58.400
when

00:54:55.040 --> 00:55:00.640
until they are revivified

00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:04.480
when they become alive engaging the

00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:07.520
scripture and then he starts executing

00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:10.559
the new responsibility so before

00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:12.880
engaging the scripture we are all living

00:55:10.559 --> 00:55:14.079
in the state of the fire as we just

00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:17.200
described

00:55:14.079 --> 00:55:20.240
after we start engaging the scripture ah

00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:22.799
now the new directive to iblis the new

00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:25.920
responsibility of the bliss kicks in

00:55:22.799 --> 00:55:28.000
with us in addition to the way he was

00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:30.480
acting against us during the stage of

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.880
the fire so in other words we're not

00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:35.440
safe once we start engaging the

00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:38.079
scripture and this is so important to

00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:40.799
many of you who tell me they tried their

00:55:38.079 --> 00:55:43.200
best people who made mistakes in their

00:55:40.799 --> 00:55:45.520
translation and their interpretations

00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:47.839
were trying their best perhaps they had

00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:50.319
good intentions yes of course but it

00:55:47.839 --> 00:55:53.599
does not mean they did not make mistakes

00:55:50.319 --> 00:55:57.119
because iblis has special instructions

00:55:53.599 --> 00:55:59.839
from allah for that period after they

00:55:57.119 --> 00:56:02.400
are revivified after they start engaging

00:55:59.839 --> 00:56:05.280
the scripture even the serious ones yes

00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:07.520
even the serious ones even dr hani and

00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:08.880
all of us watching right now yes all of

00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:10.960
us and that's why we're talking about

00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:13.720
iblees in this segment because we're

00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:15.520
going to see the detailed strategy that

00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:18.799
allah told

00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:20.480
about ibis and his tactics and how he's

00:56:18.799 --> 00:56:22.720
going to operate against us and

00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:23.680
therefore we have to learn we will learn

00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:25.760
a few

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:27.599
aspects of it in this segment and we

00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:31.760
will learn a lot more inshaallah in the

00:56:27.599 --> 00:56:34.240
coming segments so he allah replied you

00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:37.119
are among those granted este meaning

00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:40.079
iblis was given what he requested until

00:56:37.119 --> 00:56:43.359
the day of the determined time period

00:56:40.079 --> 00:56:47.040
remember here until the day of deen

00:56:43.359 --> 00:56:50.319
until the day of deen yao muddin is the

00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:52.400
time when he starts implementing the new

00:56:50.319 --> 00:56:56.000
strategies that we're going to see the

00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:58.559
new strategies to become regime to

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:00.160
become the insider of this curse from

00:56:58.559 --> 00:57:02.400
allah

00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:05.119
but there is something else going on in

00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:06.079
here when the determined time period

00:57:05.119 --> 00:57:09.359
comes

00:57:06.079 --> 00:57:12.240
then at least totally stop operating

00:57:09.359 --> 00:57:14.480
stop being useful against us we're going

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:17.200
to see this in more detail i ask you to

00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:20.559
be patient inshallah so as i said just

00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:20.559
to complete this concept

00:57:22.559 --> 00:57:26.400
is often used to indicate onus or

00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:30.000
responsibility

00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:32.319
there are many ayat in the quran

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:34.079
upon you is the responsibility of

00:57:32.319 --> 00:57:35.760
delivery of the message this is

00:57:34.079 --> 00:57:41.119
addressing the prophet and messenger

00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:41.119
sallallahu islam and in surat hood allah

00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:47.440
our lord

00:57:46.079 --> 00:57:50.079
is upon

00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:52.000
the methodology of self-correction

00:57:50.079 --> 00:57:54.960
therefore if we follow the methodology

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.960
of self-correction

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.480
shall give us more support and

00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:06.559
sustenance and spiritual nourishment if

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:09.359
we continue on that path so that's the

00:58:06.559 --> 00:58:12.480
word allah the preposition allah all of

00:58:09.359 --> 00:58:15.359
that means upon or the way or onus or

00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:17.599
responsibility etc as we just did very

00:58:15.359 --> 00:58:20.799
well so now we continue with question

00:58:17.599 --> 00:58:23.760
number three was iblis created from fire

00:58:20.799 --> 00:58:23.760
allah

00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:46.960
and we've covered all of these things

00:58:43.839 --> 00:58:49.920
before except here i'm focusing

00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:53.040
more on the concept of i am an

00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:57.040
application from him derived from his

00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:59.359
own weltensung not derived from your

00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:01.920
source of information in other words at

00:58:59.359 --> 00:59:03.960
least now is saying something a little

00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:07.599
bit different than what we thought

00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:09.839
allah is asking iblis so that iblees can

00:59:07.599 --> 00:59:11.920
speak and clarify to us

00:59:09.839 --> 00:59:14.000
in the quran of course this is as we

00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:17.200
shall see a theatrical type of

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:19.680
conversation allah is explaining to us

00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:21.760
at the voice of iblis

00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:26.079
that the information

00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:29.119
upon which iblis acts to mislead us is

00:59:26.079 --> 00:59:31.680
actually coming from him minhu from the

00:59:29.119 --> 00:59:33.119
person who is being misled not from

00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:35.040
allah

00:59:33.119 --> 00:59:37.920
and now we're starting to understand the

00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:40.640
big picture you created me from fire

00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:43.520
from the man-made dim illumination and

00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:46.799
you created him from clay and therefore

00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:46.799
we continue now with

00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:55.280
set down from it from the fire and unto

00:59:54.559 --> 00:59:57.280
the

00:59:55.280 --> 01:00:01.920
unto the earth where do you get that dr

00:59:57.280 --> 01:00:03.839
hani because in a 236 and ayah 238 which

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:06.559
we will cover in more detail inshallah

01:00:03.839 --> 01:00:08.319
in future segments it's very clear from

01:00:06.559 --> 01:00:11.280
the evidence in

01:00:08.319 --> 01:00:13.280
those ayat that setting down is going to

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:16.079
be unto the arab

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:18.880
in the meaning of scripture yes so now

01:00:16.079 --> 01:00:21.040
allah is telling you please come down

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:23.440
from the fire remember the fire is above

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:25.920
the earth so this is all metaphorical

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:28.319
representation the fire above the earth

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:31.040
come down from it and now deal with the

01:00:28.319 --> 01:00:34.240
art of the with the scripture itself set

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:37.040
down from it from the fire and on to the

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:40.559
scripture for with the scripture you can

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:44.160
no longer be conceited using it

01:00:40.559 --> 01:00:46.880
so he was being conceded in the time

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:49.280
during the period of fire before the

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:51.280
scripture before adam received the

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:52.720
scripture in that case in surah

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:55.760
al-baqarah is talking about our

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:58.079
messenger sallallahu wasallam but in

01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:00.319
other cases we will see that he's

01:00:58.079 --> 01:01:02.640
talking about similar messengers allah

01:01:00.319 --> 01:01:05.359
subhanahu wa ta'ala is telling him with

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:07.920
the scripture you can no longer be

01:01:05.359 --> 01:01:10.400
conceited using the concept of the fire

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:12.799
using the tricks your old tricks your

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:16.000
old strategies because now they have a

01:01:12.799 --> 01:01:18.480
scripture now they have a foundation for

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.839
new knowledge so you need to update your

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:24.160
skills you need to become competent in

01:01:21.839 --> 01:01:26.400
the scripture this is the representation

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:26.400
of this

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:33.040
set down from it from the old tricks of

01:01:29.359 --> 01:01:36.319
the fire and learn to deal with new

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:38.480
information that i've given humans that

01:01:36.319 --> 01:01:40.000
have given the followers of messengers

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:42.559
what is that new information the

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.000
scripture with the scripture you cannot

01:01:42.559 --> 01:01:46.880
be conceited

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.880
using it

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:53.440
what in what in the fire in the old

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:57.599
tricks you had you can no longer be

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:57.599
conceited using those old tricks

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:04.160
so thus come out come out from what from

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:07.440
your old assignment from your old

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:10.400
confined assignment to the period of the

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:12.799
fire and change your basis of operation

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:15.200
broaden your skills become more

01:02:12.799 --> 01:02:16.559
competent in new things with the

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:19.119
scripture

01:02:16.559 --> 01:02:21.839
because otherwise you are bound to be

01:02:19.119 --> 01:02:23.039
defeated four you are bound to be

01:02:21.839 --> 01:02:25.680
defeated

01:02:23.039 --> 01:02:28.559
with the scripture so the scripture is a

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:31.359
game changer for iblees now iblees

01:02:28.559 --> 01:02:33.520
cannot use his old tricks only

01:02:31.359 --> 01:02:35.599
he has to also become

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:38.319
knowledgeable about the scripture

01:02:35.599 --> 01:02:41.599
and through our own understanding of the

01:02:38.319 --> 01:02:44.880
scripture fight against us and become an

01:02:41.599 --> 01:02:47.280
insider toward banishment toward lana or

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:50.240
toward misguidance

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:52.559
so now we understand the picture allah

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:55.119
established at least initially before

01:02:52.559 --> 01:02:57.359
the scripture with the concept of the

01:02:55.119 --> 01:03:00.400
fire with the dim illumination and he

01:02:57.359 --> 01:03:02.480
could easily argue against any human

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:04.319
being who's trying to find a way

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:06.319
to allah subhanahu wa ta'ala without the

01:03:04.319 --> 01:03:09.039
scripture but with the scripture the

01:03:06.319 --> 01:03:12.319
game became much harder so allah is

01:03:09.039 --> 01:03:15.440
telling you please come out or come down

01:03:12.319 --> 01:03:17.680
from the old game and focus on

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:20.000
on this scripture because with this

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:22.559
scripture you're not going to be able to

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.359
continue being conceited and you're

01:03:22.559 --> 01:03:28.400
going to be defeated so allah is telling

01:03:25.359 --> 01:03:30.400
him learn the scripture and become

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:33.359
knowledgeable about it so you can

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:35.839
mislead people in the scripture and now

01:03:33.359 --> 01:03:38.880
in the next few slides we're going to

01:03:35.839 --> 01:03:41.319
see the strategy that iblis will develop

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:45.200
to work with this new assignment that

01:03:41.319 --> 01:03:47.280
allah gave him so now we continue iblis

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:50.240
said grant me a stay until the day they

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:52.400
are revivified as we saw before

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:55.920
they become alive engaging the scripture

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:58.000
allah says you are of those granted este

01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:00.160
now we continue with question number

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.520
three one more time continuing from

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:03.520
surah al-araf this time

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:10.440
so

01:04:25.359 --> 01:04:29.599
so the translation is he

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:30.720
said

01:04:29.599 --> 01:04:33.119
then

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:35.039
meaning after this change of assignment

01:04:33.119 --> 01:04:38.319
after this broadening

01:04:35.039 --> 01:04:40.680
of responsibility from allah

01:04:38.319 --> 01:04:43.039
with the new scripture being revealed

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:45.599
allah told us about all of this in the

01:04:43.039 --> 01:04:48.480
prior ayat iblis is responding okay

01:04:45.599 --> 01:04:52.480
here's my new plan of action here's my

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:54.400
new change here my new strategy for

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:56.720
dealing with this new event the

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:59.520
scripture with what you have already

01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:02.960
enabled me to appear as if i were an

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:05.839
intermediary between them and you bhima

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:07.280
tani i know this is a long explanation

01:05:05.839 --> 01:05:10.559
but the word

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:13.200
and riwaya is a very specific precise

01:05:10.559 --> 01:05:15.839
abrahamic locution that is used in many

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:20.160
many different stories to indicate that

01:05:15.839 --> 01:05:22.559
rawa or arawa is to come in between

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:23.440
a person and allah subhanahu wa or to

01:05:22.559 --> 01:05:26.440
cause

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:28.880
that person to take an intermediary so

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:29.839
allah explains it in many many different

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:31.599
ayat

01:05:29.839 --> 01:05:33.839
unfortunately i don't have a lot of time

01:05:31.599 --> 01:05:35.760
to do the nested interpretation for it

01:05:33.839 --> 01:05:37.280
but i need you to accept it for now

01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:40.079
inshaallah we will deal with it in

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:40.079
future segments

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:45.760
you enabled me to appear as if i were an

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:47.240
intermediary

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:49.599
between

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:52.319
allah and them

01:05:49.599 --> 01:05:55.520
i will position myself vigilantly

01:05:52.319 --> 01:05:58.880
against them what does that mean allah

01:05:55.520 --> 01:06:01.359
is teaching us that iblis plans after

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:05.839
this new event of the new scripture

01:06:01.359 --> 01:06:05.839
iblees plans to take a position where

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:10.480
upon

01:06:08.079 --> 01:06:11.599
the methodology for self-correction what

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:15.839
does that mean

01:06:11.599 --> 01:06:18.880
that means iblees will start addressing

01:06:15.839 --> 01:06:21.440
weak points in our own application of

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:24.240
the methodology and that's why i keep

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:27.680
saying the methodology has to be applied

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:29.920
in its entirety you cannot just claim

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:32.000
that you're assembling a few ayat from

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:33.680
here and there and extracting some

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.079
meanings and you're applying a

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:38.319
methodology that's not a methodology if

01:06:36.079 --> 01:06:42.000
you don't proceed further to the

01:06:38.319 --> 01:06:44.880
verification step to the validation step

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:47.680
to understanding how all of the concepts

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:50.960
fit together to really do the due

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:53.680
diligence to not fall prey into the

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:55.520
agile the hurried interpretation

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:57.599
then you're really not applying the

01:06:55.520 --> 01:07:00.400
methodology if you're not paying

01:06:57.599 --> 01:07:02.799
attention to your cognitive biases as we

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:05.680
discussed in the prior two segments the

01:07:02.799 --> 01:07:08.559
cognitive bias of sunk cost and the

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:11.680
cognitive bias of confirmation bias all

01:07:08.559 --> 01:07:14.880
of these cognitive biases and a lot more

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:17.359
are liable to detract us from applying

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:19.920
the methodology correctly what happens

01:07:17.359 --> 01:07:22.400
with iblis he's going to exploit these

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:25.520
weaknesses he's going to exploit any

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:28.480
possible way for us to abuse the

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:31.359
methodology to not use it properly and

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:34.640
if we do this we are victim to his

01:07:31.359 --> 01:07:38.640
tricks we fell prey to his strategy this

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:41.680
is what he is telling allah i will sit i

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:45.039
will position myself squarely on their

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:47.760
way to apply

01:07:45.039 --> 01:07:50.400
the methodology of self-correction that

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:52.960
means we have to be really careful more

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:55.200
diligent more careful when we engage the

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:56.400
quran even if we claim we have a

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:58.640
methodology

01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:01.280
it has to be a correct methodology it

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:04.160
has to be complete methodology

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:04.160
and then he continues

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:10.000
him and then i will attempt to defeat

01:08:07.119 --> 01:08:12.720
him at the end that means approach them

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.440
to defeat them or to defeat them so in

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:18.239
either case i did not want to say

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:21.279
that he will defeat all of us but he

01:08:18.239 --> 01:08:24.080
will attempt to defeat us at ian nahum

01:08:21.279 --> 01:08:26.560
using claims about their predecessors

01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:29.839
mimbani idihim remember when we talk

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:32.799
about musa khan lima being a day he is

01:08:29.839 --> 01:08:35.440
correcting that which came before

01:08:32.799 --> 01:08:37.679
them meaning from the predecessors it's

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:38.480
talking about the quran in that case the

01:08:37.679 --> 01:08:41.920
quran

01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:45.359
does not approve everything that came

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:47.199
from the predecessors he corrects those

01:08:45.359 --> 01:08:50.640
mistakes that were made by the

01:08:47.199 --> 01:08:53.440
predecessors or were relayed to us in an

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:57.279
erroneous way but iblis

01:08:53.440 --> 01:09:01.920
will attempt to defeat us by using the

01:08:57.279 --> 01:09:04.319
arguments or the logic that it came from

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:06.480
the predecessors so as we know in the

01:09:04.319 --> 01:09:07.799
quran throughout the quran in many many

01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:11.920
different scenes

01:09:07.799 --> 01:09:14.000
allah says that they found their abba

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:16.719
and they just follow their path they

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.759
just follow their way so iblis is smart

01:09:16.719 --> 01:09:21.520
enough to say ah i will convince them to

01:09:19.759 --> 01:09:22.799
follow al

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:24.880
follow al

01:09:22.799 --> 01:09:28.239
yes follow al

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:30.319
blindly is one of the ways of iblis it

01:09:28.239 --> 01:09:32.239
is very clear in here if you really

01:09:30.319 --> 01:09:33.679
understand the abrahamic locution

01:09:32.239 --> 01:09:37.600
mimbani

01:09:33.679 --> 01:09:41.120
is part of the abrahamic locution women

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:44.480
using their lust for prosperity what is

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:46.560
that posterity your reputation

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:48.480
things that come after you including

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:51.199
your children that you leave behind when

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:54.560
you die or including the money and your

01:09:51.199 --> 01:09:56.960
inheritance and your knowledge and your

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:59.920
published information and anything you

01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:02.480
leave behind your palaces your works of

01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:05.120
art anything you leave behind posterity

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:08.159
things that come after you the lust for

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:10.400
posterity is one of the weaknesses of

01:10:08.159 --> 01:10:13.760
human beings and therefore iblis is

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:16.400
saying i will exploit that weakness

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:19.920
one amenity him what does that mean an

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:23.199
amenity beyond their right hand remember

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:24.560
right hand in the quran refers to the

01:10:23.199 --> 01:10:28.400
righteousness

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:31.679
so allah is teaching us that iblis is

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:33.760
using that locution one amenity beyond

01:10:31.679 --> 01:10:36.640
their righteousness what does that mean

01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:39.199
meaning with fake righteousness with

01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:42.800
excessive righteousness that is beyond

01:10:39.199 --> 01:10:43.679
what allah requires us so allah requires

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:46.000
us

01:10:43.679 --> 01:10:48.560
in a certain way we do a lot more and

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.800
then we show off and then we brag it's

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:53.760
fake righteousness it is not correct

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:56.400
righteousness so iblees will exploit

01:10:53.760 --> 01:11:00.560
those types of weaknesses that are in

01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:03.440
human beings one shema elihim and from

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:06.080
their many vulnerabilities to wickedness

01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:08.320
so if righteousness is the right hand

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:11.440
left hand shema elihim

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:14.960
elihim left hands is their wickedness

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:17.600
many vulnerabilities to wickedness many

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:20.400
reasons for us to dismiss the commands

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:23.520
of allah to dismiss the information and

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:25.840
the guidance from allah to be wicked to

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:28.880
be inordinate ourselves and therefore

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:29.760
iblees will exploit those desires we

01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:31.199
have

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:33.199
for freedom

01:11:31.199 --> 01:11:36.480
for individuality

01:11:33.199 --> 01:11:39.040
for expression of ourselves for any of

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:41.760
many many different vulnerabilities to

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:44.560
wickedness that we see in all modern

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:46.400
societies including muslim societies

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:48.960
unfortunately

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:52.880
so iblis is laying out his strategy

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:55.440
first i will take a position squarely in

01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:58.080
their way of applying the methodology

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:59.600
and then i will attack them attempting

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:02.480
to defeat them

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:03.840
with claims about their predecessors so

01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:07.040
when we talk about the pious

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:09.600
predecessors etc be careful because this

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:12.159
could be coming from iblees he's clearly

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:14.480
talking about it right here women half

01:12:12.159 --> 01:12:18.400
him and their posterity

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:18.400
and their fake righteousness

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:24.320
there are many vulnerabilities to

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:26.080
rejection to wickedness to the opposite

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:28.400
of righteousness

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:31.120
and then you shall find that the

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:33.440
majority of them will not properly

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:36.239
communicate with you

01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:39.920
we talked briefly about this in several

01:12:36.239 --> 01:12:41.199
other videos before shukur and sugar

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:43.440
does not mean

01:12:41.199 --> 01:12:44.960
gratefulness or thankfulness and that

01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:46.719
kind of concept

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:49.120
shocker according to the abrahamic

01:12:46.719 --> 01:12:53.600
locution means the proper way of

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:53.600
communicating so when allah says

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:56.560
work

01:12:55.679 --> 01:12:58.640
work

01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:02.320
the verses or the scriptures that you

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:05.679
had all followers of that would and

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:09.360
be communicative using what you learn

01:13:05.679 --> 01:13:09.360
what you toil on these

01:13:10.159 --> 01:13:15.840
toiling on the scripture as a result of

01:13:12.719 --> 01:13:19.760
that work be communicative communicate

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:22.320
with allah so iblis is saying then you

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:24.719
shall find that the majority of them

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:28.000
will not adhere to the proper

01:13:24.719 --> 01:13:30.560
communication with you ah so now we

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:33.679
understand more about what it means to

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:35.600
be cursed to be cursed is to be

01:13:33.679 --> 01:13:38.640
unable to communicate properly with

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:41.600
allah that's part of his mission

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:44.560
you will find that the majority of them

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:46.800
will not learn will not be able will not

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:49.920
be competent in the ways of

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:53.920
communicating with allah

01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:53.920
now allah answers

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:07.280
you shall come out from it as we said

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:09.920
before but this time he's talking about

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:13.280
what he's talking about the new strategy

01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:14.400
because the first time he says

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:17.440
from the fire

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:21.239
now after iblees laid out his strategy

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:24.400
provided his plan of action to allah

01:14:21.239 --> 01:14:25.280
allah completed that plan of action by

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:27.199
saying

01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:30.560
you shall come out

01:14:27.199 --> 01:14:33.360
from that new strategy from your above

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:35.280
vigilance strategy where you position

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:39.199
yourself on their way to apply the

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:41.920
methodology etc etc with above tactics

01:14:39.199 --> 01:14:44.800
when those above tactics fail you come

01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:47.679
out of it you become ineffective you

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:50.880
become useless and then

01:14:47.679 --> 01:14:53.120
when that happens you will be despised

01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:54.560
and you will be banished you will be

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:58.239
banished by whom

01:14:54.560 --> 01:15:00.560
by the human beings who reject your ways

01:14:58.239 --> 01:15:03.120
who know your tricks who know your

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:04.960
tactics who know your strategy and

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:08.719
therefore now you understand the mercy

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:11.040
of allah so allah is telling us be

01:15:08.719 --> 01:15:14.159
careful you have this opponent this

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:16.400
enemy of yours not of allah

01:15:14.159 --> 01:15:18.960
and these are his strategies these are

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:21.360
his tactics these are his ways of

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:24.239
deceiving you of misguiding you of

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:26.719
banishing you from the divine revelation

01:15:24.239 --> 01:15:28.000
from the divine guidance what are you

01:15:26.719 --> 01:15:29.920
supposed to do

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:33.040
reach a point where you understand these

01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:36.000
tactics study your opponents understand

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:39.199
his plans and get to the point where you

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:42.239
despise his ways of operation

01:15:39.199 --> 01:15:44.480
and you banish him from influencing you

01:15:42.239 --> 01:15:47.600
what happens when you succeed in doing

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:50.480
this allah is teaching us that the

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:54.159
instructions the new disposition to

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:57.760
iblis is that ableis ceases being a

01:15:54.159 --> 01:16:01.840
threat to you he becomes ineffective he

01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:05.440
becomes useless no longer required to

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:08.960
carry on any tasks therefore his mission

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:12.239
is completed when he is despised and

01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:15.760
banished or if you die

01:16:12.239 --> 01:16:18.880
la mahala following iblis

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:21.520
so iblis has two possible endings either

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:24.239
you and him while you're alive

01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:26.880
by understanding his tricks and strategy

01:16:24.239 --> 01:16:30.000
and getting to the point where you make

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:31.920
sure you despise his approach you

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.080
despise what he does

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:36.400
and you banish him from your way of

01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:40.080
thinking in order to receive the

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:43.120
guidance and to be among the shakiri and

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:44.159
those who communicate with allah

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:45.920
beautiful

01:16:44.159 --> 01:16:49.280
absolutely stunning

01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:52.320
eloquent theatrical presentation of

01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:55.440
everything that we face as we deal and

01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:57.520
engage with the quran

01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:58.880
so allah subhanahu wa ta'ala created

01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:01.920
iblis yes

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:05.199
allah subhanahu wa set him up as part of

01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:07.520
our process of engaging the quran yes

01:17:05.199 --> 01:17:08.960
but in the quran he also taught us how

01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:11.600
to defeat him

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:14.640
if you believe in the quran if you

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:16.400
understand the primary evidence that is

01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:18.719
provided from the quran the

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:21.440
authoritativeness of the quran you

01:17:18.719 --> 01:17:23.360
should be grateful to allah because he

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:26.000
gave us all of these details now we

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:31.040
continue with the last part of this area

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:31.040
18 from surah al-araf allah says

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:39.920
those who follow you i shall fill

01:17:36.239 --> 01:17:43.280
jahannam with those of your type all

01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:45.600
together minkum all of you and those who

01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:47.760
follow you at least so now i'm going to

01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:50.719
leave the word jahannam for now we will

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:52.960
discuss it more in detail next segment

01:17:50.719 --> 01:17:55.360
inshaallah but for now like the other

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:58.080
words that we bypassed we cannot get

01:17:55.360 --> 01:18:00.880
into the details so this is confirming

01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:03.520
that those who follow you shall fill

01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:06.640
jahannam all of those types of people

01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:08.640
who follow you and all of them together

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:12.719
and here we have one last comment to

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:16.000
make ashmaein all together all of them

01:18:12.719 --> 01:18:18.239
together togetherness in the quran is

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.880
not something that is praised when it

01:18:18.239 --> 01:18:24.000
comes to following the guidance please

01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:25.520
pay attention to this whenever the word

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.480
ajmaru

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:30.800
is used in the quran it is often

01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:33.760
referring to something wrong

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:36.560
to some scheming to some treachery so in

01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:36.560
surah yusuf

01:18:41.199 --> 01:18:46.320
is teaching our beloved prophet sallam

01:18:43.679 --> 01:18:48.159
you were not with them listening to them

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:49.760
as they were

01:18:48.159 --> 01:18:52.880
combining or

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:54.880
messing or coming together

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:58.080
while they were being treacherous and

01:18:54.880 --> 01:19:01.199
this is the typical use of the word

01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:04.880
so here when people are coming together

01:19:01.199 --> 01:19:06.719
for treacherous reasons for scheming for

01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:09.520
belonging the quran

01:19:06.719 --> 01:19:11.760
for conveniently dismissing

01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:15.360
the ayat they don't want using the

01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:18.880
concept of nasr or using the concept of

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:21.520
reduction of application or this or that

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:24.000
all of these games and tricks even if

01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:26.800
they all agree does not matter because

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.880
the quran is telling us

01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:32.480
whenever they are together

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:35.280
or sense of belonging to a large group

01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:37.520
that fake sense of comfort that comes

01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:40.080
from belonging to the large group is

01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:41.920
what's being discussed in this one word

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:44.800
insha allah we will talk about this

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:47.280
specific cognitive bias in future

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:49.600
segments but for now i wanted to pass

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:51.920
this piece of information before we

01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:54.159
proceed to the conclusion for question

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:56.719
number three which was was iblees

01:19:54.159 --> 01:19:59.600
created from fire and the answer is not

01:19:56.719 --> 01:20:01.600
really allah taught us that

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:04.159
in the absence of the scripture he was

01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:06.560
operating based on one strategy when the

01:20:04.159 --> 01:20:09.760
scripture was revealed to our beloved

01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:14.000
sallallahu asallam allah taught us that

01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:17.760
a change of strategy was mandated upon a

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:20.639
belief allah approved the plan and then

01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:22.880
proceeded to tell us about that plan in

01:20:20.639 --> 01:20:25.760
the scripture it's all theatrical of

01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:28.719
course it's all eloquent that allows us

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:31.280
to understand in philosophical ways in

01:20:28.719 --> 01:20:35.199
ways that are like stories so that they

01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:37.679
stick in our mind so allah is sharing

01:20:35.199 --> 01:20:39.760
all of this information with us if we

01:20:37.679 --> 01:20:41.840
choose to engage the quran and learn

01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:44.719
from it and now we move to question

01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:48.000
number four what is iblis's current

01:20:44.719 --> 01:20:51.679
strategy as we saw the primary thing for

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:54.159
iblis is to lure us to ajila and to

01:20:51.679 --> 01:20:56.239
distract us from

01:20:54.159 --> 01:20:58.159
in case you are not familiar with those

01:20:56.239 --> 01:21:00.239
two terms

01:20:58.159 --> 01:21:02.719
and

01:21:00.239 --> 01:21:06.239
means the rushed interpretation in the

01:21:02.719 --> 01:21:09.040
scripture in the quran and

01:21:06.239 --> 01:21:12.320
means the deliberate applying the proper

01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:14.000
due diligence the patient the persistent

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:16.480
the perseverant

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:19.360
careful analysis of everything in the

01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:22.239
scripture and we detailed all of this in

01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:24.560
the video segment called why no mango or

01:21:22.239 --> 01:21:26.719
pineapple in the quran i encourage you

01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:29.760
to watch that video if you have not

01:21:26.719 --> 01:21:33.360
watched it already so iblees wants to

01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:36.719
lure us to ajila and distract us from

01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:38.960
i say us because this is the focal point

01:21:36.719 --> 01:21:41.360
of people watching this channel the

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:44.400
engagement of the quran and we are under

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:46.800
the threat of iblis specifically

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:49.440
using this current strategy that we're

01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:52.960
going to detail right here as we saw

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:54.480
from surat al-araf so to lure us to

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:57.360
distract us from

01:21:54.480 --> 01:22:00.320
he does so by inciting us to claim

01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:02.520
independence from our creator or to

01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:05.840
refer to some human

01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:09.199
unauthoritative sources about the quran

01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:11.520
remember i said unauthorizative sources

01:22:09.199 --> 01:22:15.120
meaning they're not authoritative like

01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:18.800
the quran is about itself so they use

01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:22.239
hadith they use mufassirun they use the

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:25.360
books of seerah they use science they

01:22:22.239 --> 01:22:28.239
use philosophy you name it all of these

01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:31.040
other sources are acceptable for them to

01:22:28.239 --> 01:22:34.159
impose of the quran but their favorite

01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:36.400
thing to use to impose over the quran is

01:22:34.159 --> 01:22:38.560
their limited knowledge of the language

01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:41.120
of the quran because they refer to the

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:43.440
language of the arab poets and they use

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:46.000
their references and their constraints

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:49.600
and their rules to apply them to the

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:51.520
quran as if allah committed to abide by

01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:55.040
the rules of the arab poets this is the

01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:57.679
worst part of using unauthoritative

01:22:55.040 --> 01:23:00.159
sources so to short-circuit our

01:22:57.679 --> 01:23:03.120
disciplined search for truth

01:23:00.159 --> 01:23:05.600
he will do the following things first he

01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:08.639
will frustrate our search for or

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:11.679
adherence to methodology itself in other

01:23:08.639 --> 01:23:13.840
words in the search for methodology

01:23:11.679 --> 01:23:17.760
he will not allow us to think that the

01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:19.600
quran has a methodology as allah has

01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:22.639
allowed us to discover that there's a

01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:26.159
methodology we've already defeated iblis

01:23:22.639 --> 01:23:29.679
in at least one aspect of his strategy

01:23:26.159 --> 01:23:32.400
in sticking to the full methodology we

01:23:29.679 --> 01:23:35.280
are defeating iblees with another aspect

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:37.600
of his strategy so at least tries to

01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:39.840
frustrate our search for

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:42.880
and adherence to the methodology

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:45.920
including overconfidence in our own

01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:48.800
observational and intellectual abilities

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:52.159
so he gets you to think that this is not

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:54.159
rational this is against reason

01:23:52.159 --> 01:23:56.800
this is against this this is against

01:23:54.159 --> 01:23:59.120
that and does not allow you to really

01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:01.840
engage the quran and learn directly from

01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:03.520
the quran on the terms of the quran

01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:06.800
itself

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:10.000
number two he tries to delude us with

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:11.280
erroneous claims about history ah this

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.360
is hadith

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:15.520
bukhari is perfect

01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:17.679
muslim you cannot say anything wrong

01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:20.080
about it you cannot criticize this

01:24:17.679 --> 01:24:22.159
person or that person you cannot say

01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:24.480
they made mistakes why

01:24:22.159 --> 01:24:28.159
this is what iblis wants you to do

01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:31.760
iblis wants us to not question

01:24:28.159 --> 01:24:33.840
our history our tradition no allah

01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:37.280
taught us that

01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:40.719
usually make mistakes iblis wants us to

01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:43.600
not question our history and our past

01:24:40.719 --> 01:24:45.440
at least has that strategy for us and

01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:47.679
therefore if we're smart if we're

01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:50.560
learning as we just did from the ayat in

01:24:47.679 --> 01:24:52.880
surah al-araf and many others we need to

01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:55.440
question everything we need to make sure

01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:58.960
that we are on solid foundation as we

01:24:55.440 --> 01:25:02.320
use authoritative sources so we continue

01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:04.560
iblis is tempting us with lust for

01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:07.120
posterity as we talked about this

01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:10.400
includes reputation accumulation of

01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:12.880
material wealth preservation of progeny

01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:16.080
so why don't you have time to engage the

01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:18.960
quran you're already 60 or 62 years old

01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:21.280
or 65 years old you have plenty of money

01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:23.920
you have your children all set on their

01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:26.400
way you have your houses and villas and

01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:28.880
palaces you have so many cars you have

01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:30.560
so much money in the bank account no i

01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:32.800
want to continue because i have another

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:34.960
10 years i can work i have another five

01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:37.760
years of accumulating wealth i want to

01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:39.679
leave more money for my children my

01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:42.400
descendants i want to do this i want to

01:25:39.679 --> 01:25:45.600
travel i want to do vacations i want to

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:48.239
do all of these other things posterity

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:50.560
things behind them things that come

01:25:48.239 --> 01:25:51.960
afterwards their priority is not to

01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:55.920
engage the quran

01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:57.440
allah is telling us using the lust for

01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:00.080
posterity

01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:03.280
is one of the failures of human beings

01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:06.480
and iblees exploits it he knows how to

01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:08.880
use it to convince us to stay away from

01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:10.639
the proper engagement of the quran the

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:11.440
proper engagement of the quran takes

01:26:10.639 --> 01:26:13.040
time

01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:14.960
takes dedication

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:17.840
do it while you're young

01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:20.239
don't wait until you're 75 years old and

01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:23.199
then you start to learn new things as

01:26:20.239 --> 01:26:24.199
they say you cannot teach an old dog new

01:26:23.199 --> 01:26:27.840
tricks

01:26:24.199 --> 01:26:29.840
allah gave us youth gave us time gave us

01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:32.400
the ability to reflect and gave us

01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:35.360
access to free resources which we are

01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:37.199
making use of with this channel to learn

01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:40.159
how to engage the quran

01:26:37.199 --> 01:26:43.199
use it while it's available use it while

01:26:40.159 --> 01:26:46.159
you're still young additionally iblees

01:26:43.199 --> 01:26:48.320
seduces us with fake righteousness

01:26:46.159 --> 01:26:50.880
people who keep bragging about all the

01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:51.920
good deeds they do all of the wonderful

01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:54.560
charity

01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:58.000
all of the prayers the extra night time

01:26:54.560 --> 01:27:00.239
prayers the how many times they do

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.960
of the quran you always see them with

01:27:00.239 --> 01:27:04.880
tasbih in their hand and they brag about

01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:07.840
how many hajj they have done or how many

01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:09.840
umrah they have done bragging fake

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:13.360
righteousness this is not the

01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:16.560
righteousness that allah demands of us

01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:19.679
in the quran and yes it could be the

01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:21.520
worst type of fake righteousness to

01:27:19.679 --> 01:27:23.440
appear righteous

01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:27.040
just so that people

01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:29.280
accept you as a source of knowledge this

01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:32.239
is one of the worst type of fake

01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:35.040
righteousness we continue at least tries

01:27:32.239 --> 01:27:38.000
to trap us in our own cognitive defects

01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:41.040
as we explained the cognitive biases

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:42.960
iblis also appeals to our own arrogance

01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:45.520
and conceit and this is one of his

01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:46.400
tricks from when from before the

01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:48.480
scripture

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:49.679
from the period of the fire as we

01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:53.360
explained

01:27:49.679 --> 01:27:55.679
and he relies on our laziness to get us

01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:58.400
to follow others i don't want to do the

01:27:55.679 --> 01:28:00.560
hard work it is too much for me i don't

01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:02.719
feel i can learn the language

01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:05.199
i have so many things that are going

01:28:02.719 --> 01:28:07.520
against me right now i'm really too busy

01:28:05.199 --> 01:28:08.560
with the kids i'm really this i'm really

01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:11.760
that

01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:15.600
many many of these arguments are just

01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:18.080
strictly based on laziness on lethargy

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:21.120
on wanting to spend time doing other

01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:22.880
things instead of applying our time to

01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:26.560
engaging the quran and applying the

01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:30.000
methodology in the right way iblees uses

01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:32.480
this knowledge about us to lure us away

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:36.639
from the proper engagement of the quran

01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:39.760
and thus from being connected with allah

01:28:36.639 --> 01:28:42.400
from being among sheikh

01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:45.679
therefore his primary directive

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:48.080
is to move people away from this group

01:28:45.679 --> 01:28:51.199
of people who are muttaquun disciplined

01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:53.199
in applying the methodology shaykh kirun

01:28:51.199 --> 01:28:55.360
connect with allah and communicate with

01:28:53.199 --> 01:28:58.239
allah in the proper way

01:28:55.360 --> 01:29:00.639
but allah's mercy is such that he gave

01:28:58.239 --> 01:29:04.400
us all of these details in the quran to

01:29:00.639 --> 01:29:06.880
teach us how to overcome iblis in all of

01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:09.440
his strategy it's like if you are

01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:11.920
working for a corporation and someone

01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:13.840
brings you the strategic plans of your

01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:17.120
prime competitor

01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:20.159
this is how beautiful what these ayat of

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:22.239
the quran that talk about iblees are

01:29:20.159 --> 01:29:24.719
supposed to provide us so now we

01:29:22.239 --> 01:29:27.360
continue with question number five

01:29:24.719 --> 01:29:30.320
what does it mean to say that iblis is

01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:33.040
regime we explained this before regime

01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:35.920
means the insider to banishment he wants

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:38.239
to incite you in order for you to be

01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:40.159
banished he drives you to be banished

01:29:38.239 --> 01:29:43.040
from the divine guidance

01:29:40.159 --> 01:29:47.679
question number six why was iblees told

01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:47.679
by allah upon you shall be my curse

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:54.000
and upon you your way shall be the curse

01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:56.320
the banishment from divine guidance as

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:58.800
we explained upon you means the

01:29:56.320 --> 01:30:01.679
responsibility is upon you or by

01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:03.840
following your way people shall receive

01:30:01.679 --> 01:30:06.480
the curse it doesn't mean that iblees

01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:10.000
himself was cursed by allah because

01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:13.520
ableis was simply acting in accordance

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:16.480
to the disposition given to him by allah

01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:20.320
and he explained everything to allah and

01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:22.960
allah confirmed his plans and proceeded

01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:25.280
to tell us about all of his plans

01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:31.199
proceeding with question number seven

01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:31.199
who is adams zouge in the ayah 235.

01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:51.840
and when we said to the angels prostrate

01:30:49.199 --> 01:30:54.239
in submission to adam and they did

01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:56.960
except iblees who refused to prostrate

01:30:54.239 --> 01:30:59.840
as we said in so many different ayat

01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:03.840
he refused and was conceited

01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:03.840
and was among those who reject

01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:11.280
those who reject reject the commands

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:15.760
from allah and we said o adam dwell

01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:15.760
you and your counterpart enter

01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:22.639
not eve no the quran never talks about

01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:25.199
eve how

01:31:22.639 --> 01:31:28.719
all of this bogus information was

01:31:25.199 --> 01:31:30.480
unfortunately imported and swallowed

01:31:28.719 --> 01:31:32.800
hook line and sinker

01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:36.320
by the books of tafsir and they were

01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:38.239
laid for us as if allah is talking about

01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:41.679
eve or

01:31:38.239 --> 01:31:44.400
or adam's wife or even adam's children

01:31:41.679 --> 01:31:47.600
and they got into details that are like

01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:50.800
well how if he was the first human being

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:53.760
and eve was the first woman how did his

01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:55.760
children intermarry and they said well

01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:58.000
the first pregnancy included the boy and

01:31:55.760 --> 01:32:00.159
a girl and the second pregnancy included

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:01.920
the boy or girl and the boy from the

01:32:00.159 --> 01:32:04.960
first pregnancy married

01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:07.520
just details that are silly and childish

01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:10.800
and fairy tales have nothing to do with

01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:13.120
the quran they bring down the quran to a

01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:14.960
level of their pettiness

01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:17.840
instead of allowing allah subhanahu

01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:19.600
ta'ala to teach us how to rise how to

01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:21.600
learn the divine guidance that he

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:24.560
provides us in the quran

01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:27.520
yuka is used extensively in the quran

01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:30.000
and in many many different places it has

01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:33.360
nothing to do with a pair of male and

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:35.040
female zouj is only referring to another

01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:38.080
element in a pair

01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:40.400
it doesn't matter which pair allah is

01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:42.400
talking about because in different ayat

01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:46.239
he is addressing different types of

01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:49.040
pairing in this case allah is addressing

01:32:46.239 --> 01:32:49.040
adam meaning

01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:12.320
you and your counterpart in jannah in

01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:15.360
jannah yes because as you fully

01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:17.840
understand the scripture as you fully

01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:19.920
receive the divine guidance it is that

01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:22.000
type of jannah we're gonna analyze it in

01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:23.679
just a few minutes just be patient

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:25.600
because we still have to get to the

01:33:23.679 --> 01:33:27.760
concept of jinn we didn't talk about

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:29.600
that yet we will talk about insha allah

01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:32.960
and we have a lot more questions coming

01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:35.920
so remain patient remain open minded i

01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:38.080
ask you and urge you to take a pause if

01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:40.560
you want to take a break if you want but

01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:42.400
to continue watching this video segment

01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:45.679
all the way to the end

01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:48.000
dwell you and your counterpart in jannah

01:33:45.679 --> 01:33:49.199
and nourish yourself from it in

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:52.560
abundance

01:33:49.199 --> 01:33:55.360
where from you choose and do not go near

01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:57.800
this shazara shajara

01:33:55.360 --> 01:34:00.960
is translated as this group of

01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:02.000
argumentative deceivers

01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:03.199
tree

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.440
no

01:34:03.199 --> 01:34:08.639
jara like kaphara

01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:10.239
like fajara all of those words refer to

01:34:08.639 --> 01:34:12.960
groups of people

01:34:10.239 --> 01:34:16.560
who are in this case arguing with each

01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:19.280
other shijar or tasha jara means to

01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:21.760
argue to to disagree with each other so

01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:23.679
this group of argumentative deceivers

01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:26.400
which group what do you think he's

01:34:23.679 --> 01:34:27.480
talking about in this context of this

01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:30.960
ayat

01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:33.440
allah is still talking about the

01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:36.400
the same group of people that started

01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:39.120
with us in ayat 26 so in this area

01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:42.239
number 35 allah subhanahu wa ta'ala is

01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:44.639
referring to them as shaajara they are a

01:34:42.239 --> 01:34:46.719
group of people who are argumentative

01:34:44.639 --> 01:34:48.400
deceivers we're going to see a lot more

01:34:46.719 --> 01:34:51.440
details about this insha allah as we

01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:53.600
continue in future segments but for now

01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:55.199
i will leave it at that and allow you to

01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:56.080
think about it

01:34:55.199 --> 01:34:58.400
for

01:34:56.080 --> 01:35:00.719
then you will be among the transgressors

01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:03.199
when if you approach or go near this

01:35:00.719 --> 01:35:06.000
shahjara you go near anywhere this

01:35:03.199 --> 01:35:09.119
baauda you take from them to receive

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:12.000
your spiritual nourishment to receive

01:35:09.119 --> 01:35:16.080
your information to accept them as

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:19.920
authoritative sources any such attempt

01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:23.040
any such action qualify you to be among

01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:25.280
the transgressors allah told this very

01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:27.920
clearly to our beloved sallallahu

01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:31.760
the quran talks about it very clearly

01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:34.880
and yet we find it so prevalent in all

01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:35.840
of our tradition unfortunately israel

01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:38.560
yet

01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:40.800
in formation that is sourced from

01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:44.159
israelite type of sources either

01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:46.880
christian sources or jewish sources and

01:35:44.159 --> 01:35:50.080
not only is it there they brag about it

01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:52.719
unfortunately so therefore this ayah is

01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:54.400
very clearly telling us don't go near

01:35:52.719 --> 01:35:57.040
this group of people

01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:58.400
because then you will be among the

01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:01.280
transgressors

01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:02.159
so how do we understand antawas

01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:06.400
ah

01:36:02.159 --> 01:36:09.840
the ayat is talking about iblis iblees

01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:14.400
is right there and as we said so far

01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:16.480
iblis is the tendency that is within us

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:18.480
to be disobedient

01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:20.480
in other words allah subhanahu wa ta'ala

01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:23.360
gave us the disposition

01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:26.159
to not accept the commands gave us the

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:27.840
freedom of choice to make a decision

01:36:26.159 --> 01:36:30.880
either to go right

01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:34.800
or to go left and if we choose to go in

01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:36.639
the wrong direction allah laid out to us

01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:39.840
the course of action he will take

01:36:36.639 --> 01:36:43.520
against us and if we choose to take the

01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:46.400
right direction allah gave us the course

01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:48.080
of action he will take in our favor so

01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:52.159
allah subhanahu wa

01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:54.080
taught us that we have that part that is

01:36:52.159 --> 01:36:57.600
referred to as iblis

01:36:54.080 --> 01:37:01.760
ah so zauzuka is part of you

01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:04.840
is actually your own ability to disobey

01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:08.639
and to be inordinate to be

01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:12.159
insubordinate to the obedience to adam

01:37:08.639 --> 01:37:15.440
makes sense now because adam as we said

01:37:12.159 --> 01:37:17.360
is here described as the messenger of

01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:19.040
allah subhanahu wa ta'ala the one who

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:21.280
brought us the scripture

01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:25.040
you want to disregard the scripture

01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:26.960
you're disobeying adam you're disobeying

01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:28.159
rasool muhammad sallallahu alaihi

01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:29.920
wasallam

01:37:28.159 --> 01:37:31.920
if you want to do this

01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:34.320
you and your

01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:35.600
counterpart eblise

01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:38.000
are gonna be

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:41.760
among ali mean

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:45.119
if you go anywhere near this shazara you

01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:47.040
are also among a volume

01:37:45.119 --> 01:37:49.280
now it makes sense

01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:51.440
do we have evidence for this dr heny

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:53.199
absolutely let's look at this ayah from

01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:57.280
surah and he said

01:37:53.199 --> 01:37:57.280
one from surah 4 yeah

01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:03.119
has

01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:10.320
all people

01:38:07.679 --> 01:38:12.719
all mankind kind of i'm gonna leave it

01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:14.960
at that for now be disciplined in

01:38:12.719 --> 01:38:19.600
seeking to connect with allah who has

01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:19.600
created you from a single type of nafs

01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:24.239
what is nafs we will see later insha

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:25.920
allah but for now just allow me to

01:38:24.239 --> 01:38:26.880
proceed without getting into a lot of

01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:29.199
details

01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:31.040
we want to translate it as the spirit we

01:38:29.199 --> 01:38:33.119
want to translate it as

01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:36.719
soul we want to translate it as the

01:38:33.119 --> 01:38:38.080
identity we want to translate it as your

01:38:36.719 --> 01:38:39.760
being

01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:42.000
all acceptable inshallah we will get

01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:45.600
into more details later but for now we

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:48.480
will leave it as nafs allah created you

01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:51.280
from a single type of nafs in other

01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:53.920
words you're all made the same way not

01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:55.600
necessarily from a single original

01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:57.600
single copy

01:38:55.600 --> 01:39:00.719
no that's not what allah is talking

01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:03.840
about and who has created from it from

01:39:00.719 --> 01:39:05.119
the same type of nafs from the nafs

01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:08.480
itself

01:39:05.119 --> 01:39:11.119
created its counterpart ah so now that

01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:13.199
makes sense so iblis who is actually

01:39:11.119 --> 01:39:17.040
being referred to in here

01:39:13.199 --> 01:39:19.280
is actually part of our own nafs makes

01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:22.080
perfect sense everything falls into

01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:25.760
place now so antawasa

01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:29.040
you and your counterpart meaning you

01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:31.119
who has a tendency to seek information

01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:33.679
and to seek divine guidance

01:39:31.119 --> 01:39:34.639
and the part of you that wants to drive

01:39:33.679 --> 01:39:37.600
you

01:39:34.639 --> 01:39:40.719
away from divine guidance so we have two

01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:42.560
parts within one nafs

01:39:40.719 --> 01:39:45.199
anywhere else in the quran talks about

01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:48.880
this many many different places

01:39:45.199 --> 01:39:51.520
so allah is giving us this cryptic

01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:51.520
description

01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:58.159
you and your counterpart and then detail

01:39:54.639 --> 01:39:58.159
it more in surah and he says

01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:10.239
and then he dispersed from their

01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:13.280
archetypes many many men and women

01:40:10.239 --> 01:40:16.080
countless men and women ah so that makes

01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:18.639
sense now so allah is telling us you're

01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:21.840
all made the same way there is the type

01:40:18.639 --> 01:40:24.320
of nafs that applies to all of you and

01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:26.800
out of the same nests there is another

01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:29.440
counterpart that has been created

01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:32.800
which is the inordinate part of you the

01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:37.520
part that is given the disposition to

01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:40.880
disobey if you so choose to not follow

01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:45.199
the divine guidance if you so choose

01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:47.679
to mislead yourself if you so choose to

01:40:45.199 --> 01:40:50.080
allow yourself the licenses and the

01:40:47.679 --> 01:40:52.800
freedoms that are forbidden in the

01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:55.679
scripture in the quran if you so choose

01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:59.280
all of that is part of you

01:40:55.679 --> 01:41:00.639
so in other words iblis is zelda

01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:02.480
of us

01:41:00.639 --> 01:41:06.239
and he's with us

01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:08.159
all the time and he's very much part of

01:41:06.239 --> 01:41:10.560
our nephs

01:41:08.159 --> 01:41:13.280
now it makes perfect sense so the answer

01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:15.119
to the above question who is adam zauz

01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:18.800
in 235

01:41:15.119 --> 01:41:21.600
iblis is man's counterpart in general

01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:24.800
not just for prophet muhammad sallam who

01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:27.520
is adam in 235 because this ayah right

01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:30.239
here aya one of surat and nisa

01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:33.520
tells us that we're all created from the

01:41:30.239 --> 01:41:37.119
same type of nafs and we are all given a

01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:40.400
similar counterpart so min ha that means

01:41:37.119 --> 01:41:43.119
this counterpart thrives on the type of

01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:44.480
understanding you allow yourself to

01:41:43.119 --> 01:41:47.040
acquire

01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:49.280
the type of divine connection you

01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:53.119
establish with allah subhanahu wa ta'ala

01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:56.320
you start steering away from allah

01:41:53.119 --> 01:41:57.520
that counterpart becomes louder

01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:01.040
noisier

01:41:57.520 --> 01:42:03.840
more of an influencer over you etc etc

01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:05.840
you start moving toward allah

01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:08.080
shutting down iblis and all of his

01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:10.719
strategies that we just talked about

01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:14.800
now you start becoming more dominant

01:42:10.719 --> 01:42:16.960
over your zealous your counterpart at

01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:20.880
least that is within you

01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:23.280
iblees learns from your veltan

01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:26.320
the more you work to cleanse your vel

01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:28.000
tension to repair your vel tension

01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:31.040
through the right connection with allah

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:33.920
subhanahu wa ta'ala the less effective

01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:35.280
iblis becomes because the more your

01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:38.239
veltan shung

01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:41.760
is constructed in accordance with the

01:42:38.239 --> 01:42:45.360
divine guidance the less errors it has

01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:46.080
the less effective is iblis in deceiving

01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:49.760
you

01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:52.000
in misleading you and it makes beautiful

01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:55.280
beautiful sense

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:57.760
so iblis is an essential part of us

01:42:55.280 --> 01:43:00.880
because allah subhanahu wa ta'ala has

01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:04.000
granted us the independent search for

01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:06.320
increasing knowledge so why is iblees

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:09.199
there in the first place because we're

01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:11.600
given the chance for independent search

01:43:09.199 --> 01:43:14.400
for information and knowledge

01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:16.639
and if you have that independence you

01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:18.080
must by definition

01:43:16.639 --> 01:43:20.639
take the risk that you will make

01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:21.600
mistakes and if you make mistakes that

01:43:20.639 --> 01:43:24.960
means

01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:28.719
you're proceeding on a new path

01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:32.800
unless you proceed on beaten paths

01:43:28.719 --> 01:43:34.639
unless you just regurgitate and parrot

01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:35.840
everything that other people have said

01:43:34.639 --> 01:43:38.480
before

01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:41.040
you're not going to learn something new

01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:43.040
and as long as you're seeking to learn

01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:46.000
something new

01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:48.960
you risk confronting obliques you risk

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:51.360
being a victim to ableism and therefore

01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:54.159
you really really need the discipline

01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:55.760
taqwa you really need to learn about the

01:43:54.159 --> 01:43:57.520
methodology

01:43:55.760 --> 01:44:00.480
you really need to learn about the

01:43:57.520 --> 01:44:04.320
abrahamic locution hodud the boundaries

01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:07.119
of lexicon the divine indications used

01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:10.159
in the quran all of those details are

01:44:07.119 --> 01:44:13.679
essential to fight and to resist your

01:44:10.159 --> 01:44:16.880
urges and the strategies used by iblees

01:44:13.679 --> 01:44:19.760
so therefore iblis is man's counterpart

01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:22.880
but he's very much created from what you

01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:25.119
already have in your own nafs

01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:28.800
so now we move to question number eight

01:44:25.119 --> 01:44:31.600
if iblees is a jinn then what is jinn of

01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:34.320
course the quran says iblis is jin

01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:36.480
but here again we have to be open-minded

01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:39.679
to learn something new that most of us

01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:42.480
have not been told before let's start

01:44:39.679 --> 01:44:45.360
with the linguistic analysis of the word

01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:47.679
jinn but before we do this i want you to

01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:49.840
empty your cup with that regard

01:44:47.679 --> 01:44:52.639
leave your prior assumptions

01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:55.440
outside the door before you engage the

01:44:52.639 --> 01:44:59.199
quran allow yourself to learn from the

01:44:55.440 --> 01:45:02.880
quran don't come into the quran assuming

01:44:59.199 --> 01:45:05.760
that jinn is a species of creation

01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:07.760
that jinn is a certain creature created

01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:09.520
by allah

01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:12.320
that has independence that has

01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:14.320
identities that have males and females

01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:16.080
all of those things they told us none of

01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:17.920
this stuff is in the quran by the way

01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:20.320
and we're going to see some details so

01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:22.320
the linguistic analysis of the jinn

01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:24.960
starts with this area which we have seen

01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:27.840
before again in the video that's called

01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:30.960
what was joseph's dream or what was the

01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:34.320
dream of yusuf ayah 76 from surah

01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:34.320
al-anam falam

01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:42.080
and when ibrahim was totally concealed

01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:44.960
engulfed by the darkness of the night he

01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:44.960
saw a cow

01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:57.520
spelled this way so from that same word

01:45:56.080 --> 01:45:58.800
we derive

01:45:57.520 --> 01:46:00.560
jin

01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:03.840
or jan

01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:06.880
or jin which is the plural of these two

01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:10.159
majnoon someone who is crazy someone

01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:12.560
who's crazy was accused of having a gin

01:46:10.159 --> 01:46:15.600
inside them all of these terms are

01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:18.000
derived from the same gerund janana

01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:21.679
which is defined right here in this area

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:24.480
so this area as we said before is um

01:46:21.679 --> 01:46:27.679
for this term

01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:29.679
it is an important area that teaches us

01:46:27.679 --> 01:46:30.800
that in the middle of the night total

01:46:29.679 --> 01:46:33.600
darkness

01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:36.560
fully engulfed fully encapsulated by the

01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:39.280
darkness nobody can see him he cannot

01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:41.840
see anything he looked up and saw a

01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:44.159
planet this is the image that was given

01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:46.800
to us to define this is the context and

01:46:44.159 --> 01:46:49.119
the image that was given to us to define

01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:52.960
the true indication of the word

01:46:49.119 --> 01:46:57.040
jannah and therefore when allah tells us

01:46:52.960 --> 01:46:59.600
about jannatun which is spelled this way

01:46:57.040 --> 01:47:02.320
it means the concealed privileged

01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:06.239
understanding and pleasure given to us

01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:09.040
by allah as we engage the quran and

01:47:06.239 --> 01:47:12.320
receive direct guidance from allah

01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:14.880
of course it's concealed you are in it

01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:17.840
you see it everyone else who's outside

01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:21.040
of it have no clue what's going on so

01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:23.679
it's the same concept so jin is from the

01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:25.600
same root so what is jin

01:47:23.679 --> 01:47:28.719
it is something concealed that's all it

01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:30.480
says why do muslims believe that it has

01:47:28.719 --> 01:47:32.880
something to do with these

01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:34.560
funny creatures that sometimes they

01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:37.119
appear to us and sometimes they don't

01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:40.159
appear to us and who knows what these

01:47:37.119 --> 01:47:42.000
fables and fairy tales that were told to

01:47:40.159 --> 01:47:45.360
us about jinns

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:48.080
because the arabs before the quran

01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:48.960
used to have these superstitions

01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:52.239
about

01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:54.480
unseen creatures called jinn

01:47:52.239 --> 01:47:57.840
the quran used the word in a different

01:47:54.480 --> 01:48:00.719
way they insisted of applying the

01:47:57.840 --> 01:48:02.320
linguistic definitions

01:48:00.719 --> 01:48:04.880
of their poets

01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:08.560
instead of seeking the hadood

01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:12.159
of the abrahamic locution or the divine

01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:14.320
lexicon that allah used in the quran so

01:48:12.159 --> 01:48:18.639
what does this have to do with iblis

01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:21.679
well iblis is defined as can i mean el

01:48:18.639 --> 01:48:24.880
jin in surat al-kaff as we just saw

01:48:21.679 --> 01:48:27.440
similarly iblis operates in the darkness

01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:30.080
in concealment without a direct way for

01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:34.159
you to detect him so how do you know

01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:36.639
he's there allah told us he is your zoj

01:48:34.159 --> 01:48:39.280
he is part of you he's he extracts his

01:48:36.639 --> 01:48:42.719
information from your weltensung he is

01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:45.520
created from your nephs he operates

01:48:42.719 --> 01:48:48.159
and you see the results so how do i see

01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:51.600
the results i see the results by

01:48:48.159 --> 01:48:53.520
analyzing my way of thinking by self

01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:57.199
examining myself

01:48:53.520 --> 01:49:00.880
how do i get rid of the effects of iblis

01:48:57.199 --> 01:49:04.159
with the methodology of self-correction

01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:06.560
with the organic quranic methodology

01:49:04.159 --> 01:49:10.000
that's how we make sure we are

01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:12.400
protecting ourselves against this unseen

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:14.320
concealed part of us

01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:16.639
i hope this makes sense it's very

01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:18.639
beautiful it's very consistent with

01:49:16.639 --> 01:49:20.960
everything that we've said so far and it

01:49:18.639 --> 01:49:23.599
makes perfect sense so what are the

01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:27.040
characteristics of iblis again he

01:49:23.599 --> 01:49:29.599
provides a dim man-made non-divine

01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:31.920
illumination in the absence of

01:49:29.599 --> 01:49:33.199
evidence-based knowledge so he wants to

01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:36.239
take you

01:49:33.199 --> 01:49:37.840
to things outside of the scripture

01:49:36.239 --> 01:49:40.320
because the scripture gives you the

01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:43.440
evidence the more you stick to the

01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:46.560
evidence to the bayonet in the scripture

01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:49.040
the harder it is for iblis

01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:51.119
not to be defeated you want to defeat

01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:53.679
iblis stick to the evidence to the

01:49:51.119 --> 01:49:56.080
bayonet of the scripture he wants to

01:49:53.679 --> 01:49:57.360
take you to the domain that he is really

01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:01.760
comfortable with

01:49:57.360 --> 01:50:04.800
the era of the fire as i explained it

01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:08.000
so he wants to refer to his area of

01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:11.199
strength to provide man-made

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:13.920
non-divine illumination sources that are

01:50:11.199 --> 01:50:17.040
not divine that are not authoritative

01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:20.159
like the quran he thrives on mythology

01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:22.480
he thrives on superstitions he thrives

01:50:20.159 --> 01:50:25.599
on flawed reasoning

01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:29.119
he thrives on half truths he thrives on

01:50:25.599 --> 01:50:32.480
a defective or no methodology he thrives

01:50:29.119 --> 01:50:34.239
on innuendos he thrives on illusion

01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:35.840
fanciful thinking

01:50:34.239 --> 01:50:37.599
wishful thinking

01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:41.199
cognitive biases

01:50:37.599 --> 01:50:43.920
incomplete understanding etc etc

01:50:41.199 --> 01:50:46.159
all of these methods that detract you

01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:47.520
from the correct way of thinking and

01:50:46.159 --> 01:50:48.480
analyzing

01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:50.400
and

01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:53.040
being disciplined enough to receive

01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:55.360
directly from allah

01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:58.719
all of these ways that we just described

01:50:55.360 --> 01:51:00.719
are ways used by iblis to detract you

01:50:58.719 --> 01:51:03.520
away from the scripture and take you

01:51:00.719 --> 01:51:04.719
back to his area of strength his area of

01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:07.760
strength

01:51:04.719 --> 01:51:10.239
the fire the ability to put you in the

01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:13.760
middle of darkness and to provide you

01:51:10.239 --> 01:51:16.080
the dim light man-made light mostly that

01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:18.639
he wants to give you

01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:21.199
and your laziness will help him

01:51:18.639 --> 01:51:24.400
your acceptance of unauthoritative

01:51:21.199 --> 01:51:27.040
sources will help at least against you

01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:30.719
i hope now you understand the answer

01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:34.080
iblis is defined as the archetypal

01:51:30.719 --> 01:51:37.199
member of the set called jin

01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:40.159
so now we don't have jinn per se as a

01:51:37.199 --> 01:51:43.360
creature defined in the quran all we're

01:51:40.159 --> 01:51:45.599
told is iblis was from the jinn so we

01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:49.040
have a set called jin

01:51:45.599 --> 01:51:51.520
without a clear definition except eblis

01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:54.480
so in mathematics if i tell you i have a

01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:56.560
set and i have a member of that set an

01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:57.760
element of that set as they say in

01:51:56.560 --> 01:52:00.159
algebra

01:51:57.760 --> 01:52:02.719
if i give you full definition of a

01:52:00.159 --> 01:52:05.440
single element in that set

01:52:02.719 --> 01:52:09.440
you understand the exact nature of the

01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:11.440
whole set in other words if i say i have

01:52:09.440 --> 01:52:12.880
a set of x

01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:15.440
and then i give you the detailed

01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:17.199
definition of x you understand that

01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:20.639
every other member

01:52:17.199 --> 01:52:23.520
in that set is exactly of the same type

01:52:20.639 --> 01:52:25.920
so by defining a single element in a set

01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:28.880
i've defined the whole set this is

01:52:25.920 --> 01:52:31.360
exactly what allah did with respect to

01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:34.960
defining iblis

01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:36.639
iblis is defined very clearly in detail

01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:39.760
how he operates

01:52:36.639 --> 01:52:42.159
the periods of his existence before the

01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:44.560
scripture and after the scripture his

01:52:42.159 --> 01:52:47.440
different strategies his areas of

01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:49.679
strength his tactics what he wants to

01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:52.400
achieve his goal all of these things are

01:52:49.679 --> 01:52:55.920
given to us about iblis and then he told

01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:58.880
you he's from a set called jinn and

01:52:55.920 --> 01:53:02.239
therefore this is what jinn is

01:52:58.880 --> 01:53:04.239
so jin is not these separate creatures

01:53:02.239 --> 01:53:07.840
separate from us

01:53:04.239 --> 01:53:11.679
jin is of the same type as iblis and

01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:15.840
iblis itself is part of us and therefore

01:53:11.679 --> 01:53:17.360
there is a jinn in every one of us

01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:20.719
that is jinn

01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:23.040
that is the set of jinn there are no

01:53:20.719 --> 01:53:26.639
secret creatures that exist

01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:30.800
independently of us there are no men jin

01:53:26.639 --> 01:53:34.000
and women jinn etc etc don't refer back

01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:36.480
to fake narrations about this matter

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:40.320
because most of these narrations are

01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:42.880
tainted and stained by the beliefs and

01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:46.239
the superstitions of the arabs who

01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:48.480
actually brought these narrations to us

01:53:46.239 --> 01:53:51.760
the quran does not say

01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:53.760
that we're supposed to believe in jinn

01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:55.920
now you don't believe me

01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:58.320
let's continue with this process so

01:53:55.920 --> 01:54:00.159
therefore any person who behaves in

01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:02.960
accordance with iblis

01:54:00.159 --> 01:54:05.760
in accordance with the ways of iblis

01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:07.920
becomes himself a jinn

01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:11.119
so the quran describes a group of people

01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:14.080
who are jinn yes because they're fully

01:54:11.119 --> 01:54:17.440
subservient to iblis

01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:19.840
they follow exactly the ways of iblis

01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:22.000
they follow exactly the strategies of

01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:23.719
iblis against themselves and against

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:27.760
others

01:54:23.719 --> 01:54:30.560
allah made that very clear so jinn is

01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:31.599
defined based on iblis not the other way

01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:33.599
around

01:54:31.599 --> 01:54:36.960
don't bring your own imaginary

01:54:33.599 --> 01:54:40.080
definition of jinn and apply it to iblis

01:54:36.960 --> 01:54:40.960
learn what iblis is and then apply it to

01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:44.080
jinn

01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:47.280
this is the process of proper thinking

01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:49.920
so of course iblis wants to mislead us

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:51.840
in his own nature in understanding his

01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:54.159
own nature of course

01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:57.679
because that's his first task his first

01:54:54.159 --> 01:54:59.760
task is to get you to misdiagnose

01:54:57.679 --> 01:55:02.480
exactly who he is

01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:05.440
so it is very normal for most people to

01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:07.520
believe that there is a separate type of

01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:10.000
creature called jinn separate from human

01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:12.719
beings that's not true quran doesn't say

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:15.280
anything about that in clear terminology

01:55:12.719 --> 01:55:17.440
in clear ayat so this is a continuation

01:55:15.280 --> 01:55:19.920
of the same concept if at least was a

01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:24.159
jinn what is jinn well what about the

01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:24.159
following ayat dr haini well

01:55:25.679 --> 01:55:28.679
feminist

01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:37.360
is clearly talking about jinn being

01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:39.119
created from

01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:41.040
created from nar

01:55:39.119 --> 01:55:43.520
and asamum what does that

01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:47.679
mean well they told us in the books of

01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:51.119
tafsir dos mufassirun

01:55:47.679 --> 01:55:53.679
is this hot wind this violent wind that

01:55:51.119 --> 01:55:56.239
comes in the middle of the desert that

01:55:53.679 --> 01:55:59.040
affects everything and can be very

01:55:56.239 --> 01:56:01.040
damaging so the obvious question is

01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:05.280
what happens in the tundra

01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:08.480
of siberia or in antarctica or in the

01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:12.000
tibet where there is no such wind called

01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:13.119
samum is there no gin over there does

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:15.760
that mean

01:56:13.119 --> 01:56:17.679
that only people who are subject to that

01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:20.880
type of desert wind

01:56:17.679 --> 01:56:23.520
is subject to jinn of course it's a

01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:26.080
silly interpretation there must be a

01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:28.480
much more reasonable way to understand

01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:30.480
the word samum and there is

01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:31.840
the proper meaning the proper

01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:35.199
interpretation

01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:37.360
is someone who is poisonous poisonous

01:56:35.199 --> 01:56:43.119
where did you get that from the word

01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:43.119
samum is derived from the morpheme foul

01:56:43.679 --> 01:56:49.840
which means excessively doing something

01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:53.040
someone who does something excessively

01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:57.719
excessive doer of something so the

01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:57.719
gerund for that is so

01:56:58.400 --> 01:57:05.040
so most herbs are familiar with the verb

01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:06.480
which is the morpheme

01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:08.400
but

01:57:06.480 --> 01:57:10.639
is samam

01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:12.800
which is the gerund and it means pretty

01:57:10.639 --> 01:57:15.119
much the same thing so the arabs are

01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:17.920
familiar with the word sam which means

01:57:15.119 --> 01:57:20.639
poison from the same gerund again so

01:57:17.920 --> 01:57:23.679
samum is from the same gerund but the

01:57:20.639 --> 01:57:26.000
morpheme fawul so my arabic speaking

01:57:23.679 --> 01:57:28.960
brothers and sisters will say wait we're

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:30.960
not familiar with such use for that word

01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:34.480
relating

01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:35.679
to poison and i say exactly

01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:38.320
what's new

01:57:35.679 --> 01:57:40.239
much in the quranic list of terms and

01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:41.920
expressions are not familiar to the

01:57:40.239 --> 01:57:43.440
arabic poets

01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:46.239
and therefore

01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:49.360
they applied their own lexicon

01:57:46.239 --> 01:57:52.960
they applied their unlimited use of

01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:55.679
verbs and terms and words to the quran

01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:59.199
what is samum ah an arab poet will think

01:57:55.679 --> 01:58:01.520
this is a desert wind a high or damaging

01:57:59.199 --> 01:58:04.159
type of wind ah we will apply it to this

01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:06.960
area where did you get that from well

01:58:04.159 --> 01:58:09.599
this is how our language is so we apply

01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:12.639
our language to the quran they said we

01:58:09.599 --> 01:58:15.119
apply our language to the quran we force

01:58:12.639 --> 01:58:19.360
the quran to be speaking our language as

01:58:15.119 --> 01:58:23.440
if allah is bound to their lexicon so

01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:23.440
clearly allah is telling us

01:58:25.199 --> 01:58:30.960
the jinn we had created before

01:58:28.239 --> 01:58:33.360
through the illumination of the fire of

01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:36.320
the poison so what does that mean well

01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:37.360
the fire of the poisonous is the actual

01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:38.159
fuel

01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:41.760
for

01:58:38.159 --> 01:58:44.239
jinn for iblis and his likes for people

01:58:41.760 --> 01:58:46.239
who don't want to operate under the

01:58:44.239 --> 01:58:49.280
light of the divine guidance under the

01:58:46.239 --> 01:58:50.480
scripture allah gave us nur in the

01:58:49.280 --> 01:58:53.280
scripture

01:58:50.480 --> 01:58:55.520
jinn wants to operate in concealment

01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:57.599
remember janna's

01:58:55.520 --> 01:58:59.599
as we talked about ibrahim they want to

01:58:57.599 --> 01:59:03.520
operate in the darkness they want to

01:58:59.599 --> 01:59:05.679
operate with them man-made invented type

01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:09.199
of illumination

01:59:05.679 --> 01:59:11.920
iblis is that prototype of jinn and

01:59:09.199 --> 01:59:14.639
therefore they like very much everything

01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:16.800
that's poisonous to our understanding of

01:59:14.639 --> 01:59:20.880
the message of allah

01:59:16.800 --> 01:59:23.520
so samum means someone who is causing

01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:26.000
poison or is poisonous

01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:30.080
therefore the fire of the poisonous is

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:33.119
what allah is talking about in ayah 27

01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:33.119
of surah 15.

01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:37.520
allah granted us the favor of protecting

01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:39.760
us

01:59:37.520 --> 01:59:41.520
from the punishment of the poisonous of

01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:44.400
course this is a group of people who are

01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:47.840
in jannah who have been saved from

01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:50.320
jahannam and are moved to jannah are

01:59:47.840 --> 01:59:52.480
moved to a place where they have

01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:55.520
privileged understanding and direct

01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:58.639
connection with allah they're protected

01:59:55.520 --> 02:00:00.080
from those poisonous sources

01:59:58.639 --> 02:00:01.920
fisa moomin

02:00:00.080 --> 02:00:02.960
and this is a description in surat

02:00:01.920 --> 02:00:05.520
al-wakha

02:00:02.960 --> 02:00:08.080
for the transgressors the disbelievers

02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:11.199
are in the ways and under the influence

02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:14.560
of those who are poisonous who are close

02:00:11.199 --> 02:00:18.159
friends with each other clearly allah is

02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:21.360
using the word samum in a very coherent

02:00:18.159 --> 02:00:23.440
congruent manner as we just described

02:00:21.360 --> 02:00:27.520
so what about the ayat that talk about

02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:30.639
jinns such as surah 72 surah al-jin or

02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:34.159
surah al-akhaf as we said earlier every

02:00:30.639 --> 02:00:37.040
person who chooses to follow iblees who

02:00:34.159 --> 02:00:39.520
becomes a lawyer follower of iblees

02:00:37.040 --> 02:00:42.239
is a jinn so that's the definition of a

02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:45.520
jinn so a jinn is a description of a

02:00:42.239 --> 02:00:48.159
human being who behaves in accordance

02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:51.119
with the characteristics of iblis as

02:00:48.159 --> 02:00:53.840
defined in the quran ibilis becomes the

02:00:51.119 --> 02:00:54.719
archetype the representative model of

02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:56.560
jinn

02:00:54.719 --> 02:00:58.159
anyone who acts in accordance with the

02:00:56.560 --> 02:00:59.679
same characteristics

02:00:58.159 --> 02:01:01.520
is ajin

02:00:59.679 --> 02:01:04.800
and with that we move to question number

02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:08.239
nine isn't the belief in jinn a part of

02:01:04.800 --> 02:01:09.920
our achida and the answer absolutely not

02:01:08.239 --> 02:01:12.400
absolutely not

02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:12.400
look at this

02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:41.760
gathers them together and

02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:44.400
asks the angels to explain the behavior

02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:46.960
of these rejecters these cafe ruin so

02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:50.000
allah asked the angels that these

02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:54.880
rejecters used to worship you the angels

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:54.880
reply your disposition is our way

02:01:55.760 --> 02:02:02.840
we follow your way you are our patron

02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:04.719
between us and them between us and these

02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:06.400
rejecters

02:02:04.719 --> 02:02:08.960
allah is the source allah is the

02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:11.760
authority allah is the protector allah

02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:14.400
is the mentor all of these concepts are

02:02:11.760 --> 02:02:14.400
in the word

02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:20.719
you are our patron between us and them

02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:23.599
and then the angels continue

02:02:20.719 --> 02:02:27.360
nay they used to worship the jinn the

02:02:23.599 --> 02:02:31.040
majority of them are believers in the

02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:34.560
jinn in them it's very clear allah is

02:02:31.040 --> 02:02:37.119
warning us don't be among such people

02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:40.800
if you still don't believe me find one

02:02:37.119 --> 02:02:43.360
area where allah tells us that we are

02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:44.880
required to believe in jinn

02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:48.159
all the ayat

02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:50.400
that list the articles of faith such as

02:02:48.159 --> 02:02:53.520
belief in allah belief in the day of

02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:55.440
judgment belief believe in the angels

02:02:53.520 --> 02:02:56.960
believe in the messengers believe in the

02:02:55.440 --> 02:03:01.119
books etc

02:02:56.960 --> 02:03:03.840
none of these ayat lists belief in jinn

02:03:01.119 --> 02:03:04.960
as a required part of the articles of

02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:07.520
faith

02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:09.840
you want to live by those superstitions

02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:12.960
be my guest suit yourself

02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:14.599
but don't blame the quran for such

02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:17.360
superstitions

02:03:14.599 --> 02:03:19.840
allah told us very clearly

02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:21.280
what jinn is based on the definition of

02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:24.239
iblis

02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:27.360
other people have corrupted

02:03:24.239 --> 02:03:29.280
this part of our akhida and added to our

02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:31.840
akida something that allah subhanahu

02:03:29.280 --> 02:03:34.080
wa'ta'ala did not put in our aqidah this

02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:37.599
is the truth of our tradition with

02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:40.800
regards to the concept of jinn so dr

02:03:37.599 --> 02:03:43.360
hani what about the stories of exorcism

02:03:40.800 --> 02:03:46.320
and all of these stories of jinn

02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:49.199
and this person who does rukya

02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:52.400
and the haunting of houses and being

02:03:49.199 --> 02:03:55.199
possessed by jinn and all of these

02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:58.320
weird weird stories that we hear all the

02:03:55.199 --> 02:04:01.440
time the answer is very simple the mind

02:03:58.320 --> 02:04:03.280
plays tricks on all of us we think we're

02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:04.800
seeing some things where in reality

02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:07.440
we're not

02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:10.480
but more importantly opportunistic

02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:13.360
charlatans thrive on profiting from the

02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:15.760
superstitious and the gullible not just

02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:18.480
muslims by the way if you go to the

02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:21.599
south of the united states there are

02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:24.560
lots of rural areas where there are lots

02:04:21.599 --> 02:04:27.199
of haunted houses and haunted mansions

02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:30.000
and ghost appearances and this and that

02:04:27.199 --> 02:04:33.920
so it's not just muslims unfortunately

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:37.040
as they say a new fool is born every day

02:04:33.920 --> 02:04:39.040
and charlatans take advantage of this

02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:41.599
type of foolery and this type of

02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:44.400
superstitions to make profits for

02:04:41.599 --> 02:04:46.880
themselves and to draw attention to

02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:49.920
themselves the quran is very clear there

02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:51.599
is no such thing as a separate creature

02:04:49.920 --> 02:04:55.440
called jin

02:04:51.599 --> 02:04:57.119
jin is part of us when we choose to

02:04:55.440 --> 02:05:01.119
follow iblis

02:04:57.119 --> 02:05:03.679
we become stained with the label jin

02:05:01.119 --> 02:05:04.639
if you want to avoid jinn don't follow

02:05:03.679 --> 02:05:08.079
iblis

02:05:04.639 --> 02:05:11.360
and allah provided you the full

02:05:08.079 --> 02:05:14.800
armor the full set of tools and weapons

02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:17.520
and instruments and methodology to avoid

02:05:14.800 --> 02:05:19.920
falling into the traps of your opponent

02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:21.679
called iblis so if you want to follow

02:05:19.920 --> 02:05:23.920
these superstitions

02:05:21.679 --> 02:05:26.639
as i said suit yourself but don't blame

02:05:23.920 --> 02:05:28.400
the quran for such concoctions and

02:05:26.639 --> 02:05:30.639
superstitions

02:05:28.400 --> 02:05:32.400
so now we move to question number 10 and

02:05:30.639 --> 02:05:35.119
i promise you this is going to get a lot

02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:37.599
easier from here on why did iblees not

02:05:35.119 --> 02:05:40.239
die and the answer is because at least

02:05:37.599 --> 02:05:44.360
is an indispensable part of every human

02:05:40.239 --> 02:05:47.119
being without a belief therefore our own

02:05:44.360 --> 02:05:50.560
susceptibility to make mistakes

02:05:47.119 --> 02:05:52.239
we would not have freedom of choice

02:05:50.560 --> 02:05:56.079
if only

02:05:52.239 --> 02:05:58.320
good decisions are allowed by allah for

02:05:56.079 --> 02:06:01.440
us we would not have iblees

02:05:58.320 --> 02:06:02.719
but because allah allowed us the freedom

02:06:01.440 --> 02:06:06.159
of choice

02:06:02.719 --> 02:06:09.520
by definition some of these choices will

02:06:06.159 --> 02:06:11.639
be mistaken so a newer more modern

02:06:09.520 --> 02:06:15.040
definition of iblis is our

02:06:11.639 --> 02:06:16.400
susceptibility to make mistakes because

02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:19.040
we thrive

02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:21.679
on learning new things and making free

02:06:19.040 --> 02:06:25.119
will type of decisions and this is why

02:06:21.679 --> 02:06:27.840
iblees did not die iblis does not die as

02:06:25.119 --> 02:06:30.159
long as there are human beings

02:06:27.840 --> 02:06:32.719
so question number 11 how many ableises

02:06:30.159 --> 02:06:35.040
are there as many as there are human

02:06:32.719 --> 02:06:39.119
beings minus a small percentage of

02:06:35.040 --> 02:06:41.840
course illah khalil as we shall see

02:06:39.119 --> 02:06:45.280
question number 12 does abilis have a

02:06:41.840 --> 02:06:47.280
doria progeny or descendants they told

02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:49.280
us that there are so many little

02:06:47.280 --> 02:06:51.280
iblisses running around all over the

02:06:49.280 --> 02:06:53.040
world and they have been doing this for

02:06:51.280 --> 02:06:55.840
centuries and the whole history of

02:06:53.040 --> 02:06:58.480
mankind and even before mankind as some

02:06:55.840 --> 02:07:02.719
of the books of tafsir say well let's

02:06:58.480 --> 02:07:02.719
look at surah kaff af50 again

02:07:09.199 --> 02:07:12.199
continues

02:07:17.040 --> 02:07:22.560
his progeny no wait wait wait just be

02:07:20.079 --> 02:07:25.119
patient and think and reflect and

02:07:22.560 --> 02:07:25.119
analyze

02:07:34.800 --> 02:07:38.880
when we said to the angels prostrate in

02:07:36.719 --> 02:07:41.360
submission to adam and thus they

02:07:38.880 --> 02:07:44.560
prostrated in submission acceptebliss

02:07:41.360 --> 02:07:47.599
he was of the jinn as we saw before

02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:48.800
and thus was inordinate in accordance

02:07:47.599 --> 02:07:50.719
with

02:07:48.800 --> 02:07:53.520
and because of

02:07:50.719 --> 02:07:56.119
his lord's established arrangement i.e

02:07:53.520 --> 02:07:59.599
the ordained organization created by

02:07:56.119 --> 02:08:01.119
allah within which iblees fits very good

02:07:59.599 --> 02:08:02.560
beautiful so far

02:08:01.119 --> 02:08:06.239
allah continues

02:08:02.560 --> 02:08:10.159
will you then take him meaning iblis

02:08:06.239 --> 02:08:12.960
and rieta who the pronoun in the yetahu

02:08:10.159 --> 02:08:15.199
right here has been attributed to iblis

02:08:12.960 --> 02:08:18.159
but who told you isabelis is the only

02:08:15.199 --> 02:08:19.920
masculine noun in the sentence iblis is

02:08:18.159 --> 02:08:23.280
a masculine noun

02:08:19.920 --> 02:08:27.119
but adam is also a masculine noun so the

02:08:23.280 --> 02:08:30.400
riyetta who his progeny refers to

02:08:27.119 --> 02:08:34.000
adam refers to adam so the ayah is

02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:37.440
saying will you take him meaning iblis

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:41.199
and the progeny of adam human beings

02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:44.239
as intermediaries between you and allah

02:08:41.199 --> 02:08:47.280
while they are enemies for you

02:08:44.239 --> 02:08:49.920
what a deplorable substitute this is for

02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:52.719
the transgressors in other words allah

02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:55.119
is telling us if you choose

02:08:52.719 --> 02:08:58.400
to follow the ways of iblis

02:08:55.119 --> 02:09:02.159
you become one of the progeny of adam

02:08:58.400 --> 02:09:03.440
that has now been tied or attached or

02:09:02.159 --> 02:09:05.199
belongs

02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:06.880
to iblis

02:09:05.199 --> 02:09:08.560
watch the next ayat and you will

02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:10.239
understand very clearly

02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:13.440
so allah subhanahu wa allah insurance

02:09:10.239 --> 02:09:16.440
israel teaches us about what iblees also

02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:16.440
says

02:09:25.280 --> 02:09:29.040
this is a clear marking between this

02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:31.119
ayah and that ayah but we will continue

02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:32.400
with more analysis so you become more

02:09:31.119 --> 02:09:33.760
convinced inshallah

02:09:32.400 --> 02:09:37.760
allah

02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:40.400
accept a few so allah says about iblis

02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:42.400
saying he said iblis said do you see

02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:45.440
this human whom you have given the

02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:48.480
ability to redress me to correct the

02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:49.840
problems i set up for him the traps i

02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:54.239
set up for him

02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:56.000
if you grant me a delay until yamun

02:09:54.239 --> 02:09:57.520
and again i'm not going to translate it

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:59.360
right now because i don't want to get

02:09:57.520 --> 02:10:02.159
these issues in this segment we will

02:09:59.360 --> 02:10:02.159
deal with them later

02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:08.320
et cetera if you grant me a delay until

02:10:04.719 --> 02:10:11.040
yamal qiyamah i shall either bridle his

02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:11.040
progeny

02:10:11.920 --> 02:10:14.880
this term right here

02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:20.800
either bridle his progeny you know like

02:10:17.599 --> 02:10:24.239
a bridle is used for a horse or an ox to

02:10:20.800 --> 02:10:27.199
control it they attach a an implement to

02:10:24.239 --> 02:10:30.800
its jaw and attach it to a rope and they

02:10:27.199 --> 02:10:32.320
simply pull that ox or horse and the

02:10:30.800 --> 02:10:35.760
horse yields

02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:37.040
so that's one meaning of the word

02:10:35.760 --> 02:10:39.920
another meaning

02:10:37.040 --> 02:10:42.400
is based on the definition of hanukkah

02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:45.360
which is to learn or to understand

02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:49.199
or to become smarter or to learn from

02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:51.440
experiences so iblees is saying i shall

02:10:49.199 --> 02:10:51.440
ah

02:10:51.679 --> 02:10:57.199
i shall put them through tough

02:10:54.159 --> 02:10:59.920
experiences that lead them to learn and

02:10:57.199 --> 02:11:01.679
that's another very legitimate meaning

02:10:59.920 --> 02:11:03.760
of the word

02:11:01.679 --> 02:11:06.880
and if we understand it this way

02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:10.719
then you understand why iblis is a very

02:11:06.880 --> 02:11:14.159
essential part of our ability and our

02:11:10.719 --> 02:11:17.440
drive to learn independent new knowledge

02:11:14.159 --> 02:11:19.840
and to seek to connect with allah and

02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:22.560
make mistakes in the process

02:11:19.840 --> 02:11:25.119
so now we understand a better picture of

02:11:22.560 --> 02:11:27.199
what's going on with iblis so iblis does

02:11:25.119 --> 02:11:31.280
not have adoria

02:11:27.199 --> 02:11:34.480
but he takes on the doria of mankind of

02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:40.320
different atoms such as companions

02:11:34.480 --> 02:11:41.639
tabian tabiata bearing etc etc imam this

02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:45.360
imam that

02:11:41.639 --> 02:11:46.400
allah is teaching us that if you take

02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:49.280
iblis

02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:51.040
and the riyadh of adam that are attached

02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:55.360
to iblis

02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:58.400
as intermediaries between you and allah

02:11:55.360 --> 02:12:01.679
it is a deplorable substitute

02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:03.920
and then you are among the transgressors

02:12:01.679 --> 02:12:06.320
this is the meaning of this area

02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:10.239
so at least does not have azure of his

02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:13.520
own allah is warning us not to take the

02:12:10.239 --> 02:12:16.239
riya of any adam as intermediaries

02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:18.880
between us and allah subhanahu wa

02:12:16.239 --> 02:12:20.480
so the example of using zuriya and

02:12:18.880 --> 02:12:23.119
attributing it to

02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:25.599
ibilise is like for example

02:12:23.119 --> 02:12:28.960
a person who teaches swimming to

02:12:25.599 --> 02:12:31.520
children or to young kids saying i

02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:32.880
taught my kids to swim of course they're

02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:35.040
not his kids

02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:38.079
but his kids in the sense that they're

02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:41.119
related to his swimming class they're

02:12:38.079 --> 02:12:43.360
attached to his ability to teach them

02:12:41.119 --> 02:12:45.280
and so on so this is something we use

02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:48.159
all the time so iblees does not have a

02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:49.520
progeny of his own but human progeny who

02:12:48.159 --> 02:12:52.639
follows him

02:12:49.520 --> 02:12:54.639
becomes quote-unquote his progeny and

02:12:52.639 --> 02:12:57.280
this is the meaning of this ayah

02:12:54.639 --> 02:12:59.599
so now we move to question number 13

02:12:57.280 --> 02:13:02.639
why did allah create a please in the

02:12:59.599 --> 02:13:05.040
first place and gave him his disposition

02:13:02.639 --> 02:13:08.239
and the answer is ableis is an

02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:10.800
inevitable negative side effect of our

02:13:08.239 --> 02:13:12.320
own need to grow and develop

02:13:10.800 --> 02:13:14.719
independently

02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:17.119
if we did not have a belief

02:13:14.719 --> 02:13:20.400
we would never be skeptical of the wrong

02:13:17.119 --> 02:13:22.320
information we would not ask critical

02:13:20.400 --> 02:13:25.199
thinking type of questions

02:13:22.320 --> 02:13:27.920
we would not ask any questions because

02:13:25.199 --> 02:13:30.960
we would be ready to submit to prostrate

02:13:27.920 --> 02:13:33.440
in submission willingly at the first

02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:36.320
invitation and at least is our

02:13:33.440 --> 02:13:39.840
resistance that allah

02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:40.800
gave us it's our own immunity to bs so

02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:44.560
to speak

02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:47.360
it's our own immunity to resist

02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:50.960
the wrong things but also because it's a

02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:54.079
side effect to resist the right things

02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:56.360
so both come in the same package they're

02:13:54.079 --> 02:13:59.119
two sides of the same coin

02:13:56.360 --> 02:14:01.040
allah ta'ala gave us knowledge about

02:13:59.119 --> 02:14:02.079
iblis so that we can learn about

02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:04.719
ourselves

02:14:02.079 --> 02:14:06.159
we ask questions that are pertinent for

02:14:04.719 --> 02:14:09.360
our survival

02:14:06.159 --> 02:14:12.320
for our development for our fulfillment

02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:15.280
and yes even for self-actualization to

02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:17.119
use the language of abraham maslow

02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:19.840
without a police we would not develop

02:14:17.119 --> 02:14:21.760
and we would remain like most animals

02:14:19.840 --> 02:14:24.800
who have not grown

02:14:21.760 --> 02:14:28.239
their intellectual capacity in millions

02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:29.520
of years in other words don't curse

02:14:28.239 --> 02:14:32.639
iblis

02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:34.880
learn about him to make use of him while

02:14:32.639 --> 02:14:37.520
keeping him under control

02:14:34.880 --> 02:14:39.840
by using the organic quranic methodology

02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:42.400
by learning from the quran about his

02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:44.960
strategies and tactics and learning how

02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:48.480
to defeat them how to counter them to

02:14:44.960 --> 02:14:51.440
immunize yourself against the traps of

02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:54.639
your own self against your own cognitive

02:14:51.440 --> 02:14:57.280
biases against your own faulty reasoning

02:14:54.639 --> 02:14:59.760
against your own faulty logic against

02:14:57.280 --> 02:15:02.560
your lack of education against your

02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:03.679
lusts against your weaknesses etc etc

02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:05.360
etc

02:15:03.679 --> 02:15:07.599
i really appreciate that you have stayed

02:15:05.360 --> 02:15:09.840
with me this long and we continue we're

02:15:07.599 --> 02:15:12.639
almost done with this segment we move on

02:15:09.840 --> 02:15:15.679
to question number 14. so how come

02:15:12.639 --> 02:15:16.480
iblees conversed with allah the answer

02:15:15.679 --> 02:15:18.880
is

02:15:16.480 --> 02:15:20.480
these conversations are theatrical

02:15:18.880 --> 02:15:22.800
they're not real

02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:25.840
just for illustration purposes that's

02:15:22.800 --> 02:15:29.280
all theatrical conversations are part of

02:15:25.840 --> 02:15:32.560
all works of eloquent great literature

02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:35.599
the quran is superior to all such works

02:15:32.560 --> 02:15:36.880
and makes use of human instruments of

02:15:35.599 --> 02:15:39.920
communication

02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:42.679
however it does not limit itself to any

02:15:39.920 --> 02:15:44.960
such instruments of communication so

02:15:42.679 --> 02:15:47.119
allah uses our instruments of

02:15:44.960 --> 02:15:49.599
communication that's why he sends adam

02:15:47.119 --> 02:15:52.719
in the first place to be an intermediary

02:15:49.599 --> 02:15:56.400
for communication purposes but allah

02:15:52.719 --> 02:15:59.199
does not limit the scripture to just our

02:15:56.400 --> 02:16:00.960
mechanisms allah does not converse with

02:15:59.199 --> 02:16:03.199
any of his creatures

02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:06.800
allah is the source of every creature's

02:16:03.199 --> 02:16:09.119
disposition so you tell me

02:16:06.800 --> 02:16:10.880
we will see insha allah how these things

02:16:09.119 --> 02:16:13.840
are interpreted in the right way they're

02:16:10.880 --> 02:16:16.719
not for conversation purposes allah is

02:16:13.840 --> 02:16:19.840
not conducting chat sessions with anyone

02:16:16.719 --> 02:16:22.079
when allah creates a creature and gives

02:16:19.840 --> 02:16:25.119
that creature its disposition it's a

02:16:22.079 --> 02:16:27.360
done deal allah commands something allah

02:16:25.119 --> 02:16:29.040
gives the exact command for that

02:16:27.360 --> 02:16:31.599
creature to follow and if the

02:16:29.040 --> 02:16:33.920
disposition of that creature does not

02:16:31.599 --> 02:16:37.280
necessitate that that creature follows

02:16:33.920 --> 02:16:40.160
the command we see a theatrical type of

02:16:37.280 --> 02:16:42.800
discussion where allah is illustrating

02:16:40.160 --> 02:16:45.920
for our own benefit to learn using a

02:16:42.800 --> 02:16:49.359
story using an imaginary conversation

02:16:45.920 --> 02:16:52.719
between allah and iblees why iblis is

02:16:49.359 --> 02:16:55.359
not obligated to follow the commands

02:16:52.719 --> 02:16:58.080
so these conversations are only for

02:16:55.359 --> 02:17:01.519
teaching us about ourselves

02:16:58.080 --> 02:17:04.160
this is part of the mercy of allah

02:17:01.519 --> 02:17:06.719
question number 15 we're almost done

02:17:04.160 --> 02:17:11.519
why was iblees personified in the quran

02:17:06.719 --> 02:17:11.519
if he is only a part of our nafs

02:17:11.599 --> 02:17:17.040
the answer is there are many dialogues

02:17:14.319 --> 02:17:20.000
in the quran between man and his skin or

02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:20.000
man in his feet

02:17:20.240 --> 02:17:22.800
they're talking to their skin or their

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:26.800
feet

02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:29.840
etc it does not make the skin or defeat

02:17:26.800 --> 02:17:32.000
a person it does not mean that iblis is

02:17:29.840 --> 02:17:34.319
a separate person just because there is

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:36.800
some sort of conversation going on

02:17:34.319 --> 02:17:39.599
between allah and iblees

02:17:36.800 --> 02:17:41.359
number 16 is at least an evil opponent

02:17:39.599 --> 02:17:43.599
of allah and of course the answer should

02:17:41.359 --> 02:17:46.479
be very obvious by now allah does not

02:17:43.599 --> 02:17:48.479
create any evil iblis is not an opponent

02:17:46.479 --> 02:17:51.519
of allah in the first place allah

02:17:48.479 --> 02:17:54.479
created iblis iblis is a creature that

02:17:51.519 --> 02:17:55.760
is subservient to allah within the

02:17:54.479 --> 02:17:59.439
freedoms

02:17:55.760 --> 02:18:01.040
of his disposition of his character

02:17:59.439 --> 02:18:04.319
allah

02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:06.639
created every part of creation and given

02:18:04.319 --> 02:18:10.000
it its own disposition

02:18:06.639 --> 02:18:12.319
in do proportions for certain reasons

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:13.359
some reasons we know and some reasons we

02:18:12.319 --> 02:18:15.920
don't

02:18:13.359 --> 02:18:19.760
it doesn't mean we have to understand

02:18:15.920 --> 02:18:21.200
every reason that allah uses for his

02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:25.359
creation

02:18:21.200 --> 02:18:29.040
evil is only caused by our own actions

02:18:25.359 --> 02:18:31.439
and our own perceptions and our own lack

02:18:29.040 --> 02:18:33.519
of connection to allah

02:18:31.439 --> 02:18:35.840
and therefore as we come to the closure

02:18:33.519 --> 02:18:38.000
of this segment i want to share with you

02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:39.599
an urgent call to action based on

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:41.679
everything that we've discussed so far

02:18:39.599 --> 02:18:44.000
in this segment and i know it has been

02:18:41.679 --> 02:18:46.880
very long and i really appreciate your

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:49.200
patience and your perseverance but this

02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:51.679
really is a very important call to

02:18:49.200 --> 02:18:53.040
action to all muslim education

02:18:51.679 --> 02:18:56.399
professionals

02:18:53.040 --> 02:18:58.719
teachers involved in education in school

02:18:56.399 --> 02:19:01.599
in academies in universities

02:18:58.719 --> 02:19:02.880
to all parents to all ministries of

02:19:01.599 --> 02:19:05.439
education

02:19:02.880 --> 02:19:07.679
to all cultural influences

02:19:05.439 --> 02:19:10.479
public media professionals

02:19:07.679 --> 02:19:13.599
we really need to discard our fictitious

02:19:10.479 --> 02:19:15.679
beliefs in jin and iblees

02:19:13.599 --> 02:19:16.880
and we need to learn to create a

02:19:15.679 --> 02:19:19.920
balanced

02:19:16.880 --> 02:19:22.319
sense of understanding of ourselves i

02:19:19.920 --> 02:19:24.880
know the concept seems difficult but

02:19:22.319 --> 02:19:28.080
it's really not all you have to do is to

02:19:24.880 --> 02:19:29.840
explain to children that just like we

02:19:28.080 --> 02:19:32.559
are driven to learn

02:19:29.840 --> 02:19:35.200
we're also driven to possibly

02:19:32.559 --> 02:19:37.679
make the wrong learnings make the wrong

02:19:35.200 --> 02:19:40.240
assumptions make the wrong decisions

02:19:37.679 --> 02:19:41.679
that's all that iblees is and you have

02:19:40.240 --> 02:19:45.280
to be careful

02:19:41.679 --> 02:19:48.319
not to give yourself undue heartiness

02:19:45.280 --> 02:19:51.040
undo conceit trusting every opinion that

02:19:48.319 --> 02:19:53.840
you have that it must be true

02:19:51.040 --> 02:19:56.000
you have to learn to control your own

02:19:53.840 --> 02:19:57.920
tendencies to make mistakes that's all

02:19:56.000 --> 02:20:00.800
that iblees is
