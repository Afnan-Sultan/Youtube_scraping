00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:06.240
i hope after the last segment where we

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:09.200
have introduced the topic of adam and

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.240
the concept that adam was really not the

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.719
first human being ever created that you

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.119
have taken the time to really learn and

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.840
understand and reflect and think about

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:23.439
how the quran presented the concept of

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.760
adam in a totally novel and creative

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.160
manner bismillah

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.160
alhamdulillah

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.160
is

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.640
i invite you with this segment to remain

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.280
with us insha'allah all the way till the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.600
end because we're introducing several

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.079
new concepts in relationship to the

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.559
story of adam and we will continue in

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.280
sha allah with the ayat from surat

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.760
al-baqarah ayad 32 and 33 but we will do

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.239
several nested interpretations that will

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.039
take us into several other surahs and

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.840
other places in the quran that elucidate

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:06.240
and explain details that are not

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.200
provided in relationship or in

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.360
association with the story of adam

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:16.560
before this segment is part number 2.7

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.400
of the series called why no stories

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.400
equal no quran i ask you that you watch

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.320
all the other ones in the series before

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.640
getting into this video you will not

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.640
learn much from this video you will find

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.840
it perhaps strange and maybe

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.240
unacceptable if you do not pay attention

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.759
to all of the concepts that we presented

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.320
from the prior videos in this series in

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:43.280
this segment we continue the discourse

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.799
on zikr vikr which means the quranic

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.040
stories and parables i invite you to

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.079
share with us in how we extract

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.799
abrahamic locution specific terminology

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.600
of the quran using the stories of the

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.159
quran and the parables of the quran as

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.719
we said before we describe the concept

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.759
of adam in a very clear manner but we

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:10.080
stress the concept that adam was not the

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:13.040
very first human being created by allah

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.120
in ayah 32 and 33 we're going to be

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.560
introduced to additional aspects and

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.319
dimensions of the story of adam and we

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.640
have several gifts for you in this

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.879
segment some of them will give you

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.000
additional confidence in the approach

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:30.480
we're following and in the fact that you

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.560
are given the authority to seek direct

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.200
guidance from allah

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.440
i ask you and urge you to stay with us

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.080
all the way to the end because there's a

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.120
very important conclusion that we will

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.720
close this segment with so inshaallah

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.680
you will be with us all the way to the

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.879
end

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.360
we assume that you know that other parts

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:53.680
of this series are very relevant to

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.680
understand this video we really need you

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.760
to empty your cup we always say this

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.040
expression and i remind you that it

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.080
means that you need to forget all of the

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.959
things you were taught and start fresh

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.680
start with virgin eyes start with the

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.159
approach that i'm here to learn from the

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.159
quran not the other way around

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:17.519
we don't bring into the quran some

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:20.480
assumptions or some other sources that

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:23.360
are not authoritative at all to dominate

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.280
over the quran so i ask you to pay

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.280
attention to the quranic methodology

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.760
that we use which is a methodology

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.440
extracted from within the quran because

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.599
the quran is unique there is nothing

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.720
like it and therefore if allah revealed

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:39.280
the quran which is a unique artifact a

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.760
unique thing that allah provided to us

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.000
there is nothing like it therefore allah

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.879
is the one who teaches us how to engage

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.239
the quran how to deal with the quran so

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:52.400
that we receive the proper value from it

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.720
we will use the concept of nested

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.439
interpretation as i mentioned before

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.239
and we rely heavily on the concept of

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:02.400
abrahamic locution here in this segment

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.439
you're going to see further illustration

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.640
of this concept in very clear manner i

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:11.040
urge you please do not comment or ask

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.319
questions in the comment stream unless

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.239
you have seen the full video very often

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.880
your questions are answered already

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.040
within the segment so what causes us to

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.720
keep diving into this important story

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.520
what makes this story

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.320
important the reality is there are many

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.199
questions that are not answered properly

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.280
or satisfactorily

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:35.520
allah gave us the story of adam but it

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.160
seems based on the explanation that we

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.320
have in the books of tafsir and based on

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.759
the translations and based on the

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.360
confusion

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:48.080
of what sources we use to what we refer

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.240
to in understanding the story of adam it

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.840
has left a lot more confusion and

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.160
ambiguity than clarity hopefully with

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.560
this segment and the one before it and

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.039
the segments that follow insha allah you

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.560
will learn to understand a lot more of

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:06.800
the story of adam in a consistent manner

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.880
so some of those questions that are left

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.720
unanswered that we will deal with insha

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.039
allah not necessarily in this segment

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.400
but in the future segments

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:17.520
was adam alone or was he with his

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.400
what does

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.600
mean

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.759
was shaitaan with them or with him alone

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.759
in jannah this is a very important

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:27.680
question that we need to ask there are a

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:31.199
lot of interactions between adam and

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.759
shaytan and and adam and his zelda in

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:35.600
jannah with shaitaan was shaitan with

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:37.680
them in jannah what was he doing there

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.479
in general of course this is a question

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.479
that was not addressed satisfactorily by

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:44.800
any of the interpreters or the books of

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:48.639
tafsir or translators was he in the

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:51.039
jannah of afterlife before being lowered

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:55.120
to earth why did they have to cover

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:57.440
themselves with the leaves of jannah

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.479
was he a prophet is there any indication

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:04.160
in the quran that adam was specifically

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:05.759
designated as a prophet per se did he

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.720
receive

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:11.039
those are all important questions that

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.160
are not addressed by the traditional

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:17.039
books of tafsir why is adam not listed

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:20.800
among the lists of prophets in several

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:24.560
such lists such as surah al-anam surah

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:27.280
number 6 al-anbiya number 21 surah

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:30.560
maryam number 19 etc

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.440
why did the quran not tell us about imra

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.560
who

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:38.080
his subordinate wife or his subordinate

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:41.120
woman so to speak just like allah

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.800
referred to nur had imra ibrahim had

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.360
imra

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.400
ibrahim

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.039
and so on

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.039
was there a direct link between adam and

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:53.759
the creation of human beings is there

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:56.720
any direct link in the quran that we can

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:59.440
point to put our finger on and say the

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:02.080
quran clearly states that adam was the

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.840
first creation first human being of

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.400
course the answer is no but all of these

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.800
questions will be addressed by the

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.960
exposition that we offer in this segment

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.639
the prior segment and the segments that

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.400
follow inshallah

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:17.599
finally when we approach the quran to

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:20.560
learn i remind you we cannot presume

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:22.479
to be true already before we start

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.240
that the corrupted version of the story

00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:25.919
of adam is correct

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.240
we cannot presume that the quran

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:30.639
provided explicit knowledge about the

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:33.520
beginning of human creation we cannot

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:36.080
presume that the quranic text itself the

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.880
6236

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:42.000
ayat encapsulate all the divine

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:44.960
knowledge allah has knowledge that is

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.639
way beyond the content of any book no

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:51.280
matter what size that book is so those

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:53.440
are reminders i want to remind you also

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.039
that none of this story is really

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.039
touching on

00:07:55.039 --> 00:08:00.960
this story specifically the story of

00:07:57.039 --> 00:08:04.160
adam does not change the fundamentals of

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:05.680
the creed of monotheism a tawhid we're

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.000
not talking about

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:10.479
we're talking about a story or several

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.800
paragraphs that refer to several

00:08:10.479 --> 00:08:15.840
messengers and prophets etc who allah

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.479
told us

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.319
some of their stories so we're dealing

00:08:18.479 --> 00:08:23.039
with the story of adam within that

00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:26.319
context within that scope so therefore

00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:28.400
it is not addressing monotheism if allah

00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:30.720
did not tell us about the creation of

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.839
human beings in the quran it does not

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:38.000
mean we're taking away from monotheism

00:08:33.839 --> 00:08:40.240
or from our strong belief in monotheism

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.240
those are two separate things so please

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:45.200
keep things in perspective keep your

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:49.040
mind open so you can learn freely from

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:52.399
the quran as allah expects us to

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:56.000
remember that the prophets of allah

00:08:52.399 --> 00:08:58.720
would never add any detail to stories

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.240
that are told in the quran and we always

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.240
refer to this paragraph

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:17.360
muhammad added any declaration any

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:20.240
additional detail on top of our

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:22.000
declarations this is allah speaking the

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.519
declarations about the stories the

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.120
declaration about

00:09:24.519 --> 00:09:29.040
allah gave us

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.279
we would have punished him

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.160
and then we would have severed his life

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:34.640
vein

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:37.519
and then none of you would have been a

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:40.080
shield protecting him so remember the

00:09:37.519 --> 00:09:43.200
prophet sallallahu alaihi was prohibited

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:45.279
from adding any details to the story so

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:48.320
i don't want you to take in

00:09:45.279 --> 00:09:50.080
consideration any reported narration

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.920
that the prophet said this or the

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.000
prophet said that or this is an

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.560
additional detail that was provided in a

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.959
hadith or this is an additional detail

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:01.839
that was provided by some companion it

00:09:58.959 --> 00:10:03.519
doesn't matter this area negates all of

00:10:01.839 --> 00:10:06.880
those possibilities

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:08.880
only what is in the quran can be learned

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.560
we can extract information based on

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.279
what's in the quran

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:15.360
other sources let them decide what they

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:17.440
want to do with this information so i

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.920
remind you that we do not teach the

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:22.880
corrupted version of the torah or the

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:26.000
injil we only teach the quran in other

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:29.839
words we do not believe that the quran

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.240
is torah version 2.0 don't accept that

00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:36.079
theory don't accept that concept that

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:38.800
the quran brought updated information

00:10:36.079 --> 00:10:41.360
in relationship to the same stories that

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.200
are told in the in the torah nowhere the

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:47.200
quran says that as a matter of fact the

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:49.680
quran tells us these stories correct a

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:52.160
lot of the lies and the deceitful

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:54.640
reports that are available in their

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.800
corrupted versions of the older

00:10:54.640 --> 00:11:00.000
scriptures so we need to keep things in

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:03.120
perspective the reality the truth comes

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.680
exclusively from the quran nowhere else

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:07.440
we don't teach the torah on this channel

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:10.000
if you're interested in the stories that

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:13.120
make you comfortable because you heard

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.440
these stories as a child the childhood

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:18.959
stories the stories that are full of

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:21.200
mythology and strange facts and strange

00:11:18.959 --> 00:11:23.360
claims go watch some other channel

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:26.240
please this is not a channel for you

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:27.519
this channel focuses on the quran if

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.880
you're interested in learning what the

00:11:27.519 --> 00:11:31.200
quran says

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:33.680
and limit ourselves to what allah

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:35.760
subhanahu wa ta'ala wants us to learn

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.760
this is the right channel for you i hope

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.200
you stick with us and you continue with

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.000
this segment and future segments

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:45.120
inshaallah a quick reminder about baauda

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.640
we talked about this in segment 2.4 in

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:50.959
part 2.4 of this same series

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:53.920
refers to a group of people from bani

00:11:50.959 --> 00:11:56.560
israel not all of them just a group of

00:11:53.920 --> 00:12:00.320
of them who rejected the guidance

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:01.760
rejected al-huda from marisa alaysalam

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.320
and from muhammad sallallahu alaihi

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:06.720
wasallam and even from musa there is a

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:08.639
group of people who rejected moosa and

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:12.160
they still claim to be

00:12:08.639 --> 00:12:15.360
from beni israel they are ethnic

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:18.480
ethnic followers but some of them are

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:21.200
atheists they reject god altogether

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:23.120
there is something called atheist jew

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.120
which doesn't make sense if you write it

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:28.079
down and you look at it and say it

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:31.519
doesn't make sense jew means monotheist

00:12:28.079 --> 00:12:34.240
no they call themselves atheist jews and

00:12:31.519 --> 00:12:37.040
some of the biggest names in militant

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.480
atheism that you watch on videos on

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:41.040
youtube everywhere

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:43.760
are actually referring to themselves as

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:47.360
jews so they are calling themselves jews

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.720
but they're atheists go figure so allah

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:51.680
taught us about

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.399
there's a group of beni israel not all

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.639
of them

00:12:52.399 --> 00:12:56.959
therefore this group who are divided

00:12:54.639 --> 00:12:59.680
among themselves and yet they regularly

00:12:56.959 --> 00:13:02.240
actively seek to divide others and they

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:04.480
regularly actively bite others

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:08.000
hurting them injecting them with

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:11.519
information and misleading notions that

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.160
actually cause harm to them and harm to

00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:16.399
the society in prior segments in this

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.320
series we confirm that there was no

00:13:16.399 --> 00:13:20.480
meeting between allah and the angels

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:22.880
allah does not need to meet with anyone

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:25.639
especially the angels who are fully

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:28.240
subservient and they obey

00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:32.079
unquestionably they don't even ask

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:34.639
questions allah told us that the angels

00:13:32.079 --> 00:13:37.600
never ask questions and allah

00:13:34.639 --> 00:13:40.240
told us that his instructions are always

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:43.600
perfect there is no need for follow-up

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:46.480
for clarification or for elucidation or

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:48.399
for the purposes of others learning

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:50.800
these are games allah

00:13:48.399 --> 00:13:54.040
does not need to play neither with the

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:58.480
angels nor with any of his creation so

00:13:54.040 --> 00:14:01.040
allah confirmed that in ayah 2 30 ayah

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:03.279
30 of surah al-baqarah the angels did

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.360
not ask it was

00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:08.160
not only they were asking they were

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:11.519
declaring in an interrogative statement

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:14.880
style in a question form which is part

00:14:11.519 --> 00:14:17.440
of their corrupt locution they were

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:21.440
declaring a challenge to allah a

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:23.760
challenge when allah decided to allow

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.760
other stewards to carry the

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:27.920
responsibility for the scripture and

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:30.079
therefore they were not talking about

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:33.519
adam at all they were talking about the

00:14:30.079 --> 00:14:36.560
notion of them losing power and losing

00:14:33.519 --> 00:14:38.480
exclusive control over the knowledge

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:41.199
from the scripture so we continue

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:44.079
inshaallah with another reminder please

00:14:41.199 --> 00:14:46.040
do not assume into a story more than its

00:14:44.079 --> 00:14:49.760
composition indicates

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:52.320
allah does not forget allah does not

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:55.279
neglect to give you some details if he

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:57.360
restrains the text to specific

00:14:55.279 --> 00:15:00.320
information we need to stop there we

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:02.800
don't go in filling in missing data

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:05.120
missing information missing details do

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:07.279
not come in assuming

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:09.680
already before you start reading the

00:15:07.279 --> 00:15:12.399
quran that adam was the first human

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:15.199
being and now remember khalifa

00:15:12.399 --> 00:15:17.120
as we explained before does not indicate

00:15:15.199 --> 00:15:20.880
adam there is no connection direct

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:24.000
connection between khalifa and adam some

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:26.240
khalifa are adam and some adam are

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.120
khalifah and so on so forth but not

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:31.600
every khalifa is adam and not every adam

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:34.320
is khalifa so khalifa indicates

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:37.040
alternating steward of the scripture

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:40.079
that means generation after generation

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:43.120
they take over the responsibility of

00:15:40.079 --> 00:15:44.399
caring for and sharing the information

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:47.040
in the scripture

00:15:44.399 --> 00:15:48.480
this includes us right now and i hope

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:51.279
that you are assuming that

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:54.800
responsibility and accepting that label

00:15:51.279 --> 00:15:56.399
by allah that you are khalifah in the

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:58.720
scripture

00:15:56.399 --> 00:16:02.560
another reminder is that adam the word

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:04.880
adam means selected familiar proxy we

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:08.160
talked about this before adam means an

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:10.399
agent or a means to achieve a mission

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:12.399
selected by allah

00:16:10.399 --> 00:16:14.320
for the purposes of achieving that

00:16:12.399 --> 00:16:16.639
mission because

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:19.600
adam or that person who was selected to

00:16:16.639 --> 00:16:22.000
be adam has familiarity with the target

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:23.839
audience not that allah does not have

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.759
the familiarity of course allah has

00:16:23.839 --> 00:16:29.680
familiarity with everybody and

00:16:25.759 --> 00:16:32.480
everything but allah is making it easier

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:35.360
for the target audience to receive from

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:37.839
one of them and therefore he designate

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:41.360
an adam he designates a selected

00:16:37.839 --> 00:16:44.160
representative a proxy to speak on his

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:47.279
behalf for a limited period of time with

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:49.440
limited authority clarifying a specific

00:16:47.279 --> 00:16:50.560
message clarifying a specific

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:53.440
instruction

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:55.759
delivering a specific task and so on and

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:57.920
so forth this is the means so it's a

00:16:55.759 --> 00:17:00.800
connection between allah subhanahu wa

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:03.120
ta'ala and a group of his creation in

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:05.439
the case of muhammad sallallahu alaihi

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:08.480
he is the means to deliver a message

00:17:05.439 --> 00:17:12.000
that is meant for all mankind for all

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:14.319
time to come as we see so adam is a

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.559
demonstrative as we said it's a variable

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:18.720
it's like the variable x in the book of

00:17:16.559 --> 00:17:21.919
mathematics and we gave the example of

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.919
the word insane

00:17:22.799 --> 00:17:28.240
etc etc all of those words are used in

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:30.480
the quran not to mean one specific

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:32.400
person but they're variables so

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:35.039
depending on their context they mean

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:37.200
something different adam is one of those

00:17:35.039 --> 00:17:39.200
variables depending on the context

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.440
depending on which surah depending on

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:43.600
which story

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:46.160
allah may give you specific details in

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:48.799
its context to let you think and reflect

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:51.520
ah who is this adam in here and who is

00:17:48.799 --> 00:17:54.559
that that adam in there and so on so

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:58.840
there are not just one adam there are

00:17:54.559 --> 00:18:00.960
many atoms so in conclusion i am adam

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:04.320
allah subhanahu wa ta'ala has selected

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:06.799
me just like i hope he selects you to

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:10.320
deliver some of the knowledge that we

00:18:06.799 --> 00:18:13.039
are endowed with so when allah guides us

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:16.160
to new discoveries to new knowledge to

00:18:13.039 --> 00:18:19.760
new evidence beinet we are responsible

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:23.840
to share them so we choose we elect to

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:27.120
take that role of adam selected proxy

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:29.760
selected representative speaking in the

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.919
context and the confines of what we know

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:34.320
and inshallah we will not make mistakes

00:18:31.919 --> 00:18:37.440
but some adams in the quran as we talked

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:39.840
about in surat taha when adam was

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:42.880
representing haroon

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:44.240
harun made a mistake he forgot fenesia

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:47.679
we talked about this in the prior

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:51.440
segment we all make mistakes even then

00:18:47.679 --> 00:18:53.760
we are adam and we choose to be adam so

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:56.480
i am choosing to be adam i hope you

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:59.840
raise your hand right now and say i'm

00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:02.720
choosing to be adam i'm choosing to be a

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:05.520
selected proxy to deliver some of this

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:07.919
knowledge to take on the mission to

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:11.440
explain to people the beauty and the

00:19:07.919 --> 00:19:14.160
majesty and the marvels that are present

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:16.240
in the quran in the words of allah

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:18.320
so with that we go back to some of the

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:20.320
ayat that we covered in the prior

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:22.559
segments because we're going to get to

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:24.400
the first gift that i'm going to share

00:19:22.559 --> 00:19:26.640
with you very soon

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:30.559
but first i need to revisit some of the

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:32.160
translation of the first two ayat from

00:19:30.559 --> 00:19:36.840
the earlier segments

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.840
so aya 2 30 says

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:55.919
in the prior segment i told you that the

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:59.360
one in green is allah speaking in this

00:19:55.919 --> 00:20:00.720
segment i'm making a change in favor of

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:03.360
teaching you

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:06.080
something new some new information that

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:08.320
became revealed in the following yet and

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:10.480
therefore we have the right and we have

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:12.159
the obligation when we discover

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:15.120
something new later

00:20:12.159 --> 00:20:18.640
we go back to the earlier ayat and

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:20.880
repair or fix or add the information to

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:24.159
what we thought we knew in the earlier

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:26.320
ayat so let's translate

00:20:24.159 --> 00:20:29.520
2 30.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:31.919
says when your lord said to the angels

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:35.280
in prior scriptures remember this is

00:20:31.919 --> 00:20:37.919
declared in prior scriptures i always

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:40.400
establish a successor steward

00:20:37.919 --> 00:20:41.919
responsible entity

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:45.919
in the scripture

00:20:41.919 --> 00:20:50.240
they the baoda retorted meaning rejected

00:20:45.919 --> 00:20:52.159
and objected or refused saying you are

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:55.679
allowing in it people who will corrupt

00:20:52.159 --> 00:20:58.640
in it and who will cause bloodshed while

00:20:55.679 --> 00:21:01.440
we perform in accordance with your ways

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:04.559
and praises and while we perform

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:06.880
flawlessly as he commanded us therefore

00:21:04.559 --> 00:21:10.280
here we see and we talked about this in

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:13.840
segment 2.5 and 2.6 that

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:16.480
allah is reporting to us exactly what

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:19.440
they said in the form of a question a

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:22.559
seeming interrogative statement but in

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:25.840
reality it is a rhetorical question it's

00:21:22.559 --> 00:21:28.559
an accusation against allah subhanahu wa

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:31.440
that you gave us the covenant you gave

00:21:28.559 --> 00:21:33.360
us the agreement the commitment that we

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.880
will have that responsibility and they

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.720
thought they will have the

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:40.240
responsibility because they are the

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:42.559
chosen people allah is telling them no

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:44.480
this responsibility will be handed to

00:21:42.559 --> 00:21:47.280
other people who will carry that

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:50.080
responsibility to the extent that it is

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:53.440
designed to be carried not because of

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:56.000
your lineage of your ethnicity that i

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:58.799
selected you i selected a group of

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.960
people who are committed to deliver and

00:21:58.799 --> 00:22:03.360
since you did not deliver this

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:06.400
responsibility of stewardship will be

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:09.280
handed to some other group their retort

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:11.200
or their reply was no no no you're

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:13.039
making a mistake

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:15.600
that's exactly what they're saying in

00:22:13.039 --> 00:22:17.600
the form of a question we explained all

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:20.799
of this before so as you see in the

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:23.039
translation there is no question because

00:22:20.799 --> 00:22:26.000
they did not intend to ask a question

00:22:23.039 --> 00:22:28.799
this was a rhetorical question to which

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.320
they presumed to know the answer and

00:22:28.799 --> 00:22:36.240
such is the behavior of al-ba'auda we

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:36.240
continue in this green part

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:42.000
in the prior segments i said this is

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:44.720
allah speaking in this segment i'm

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.919
modifying it to give you an additional

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:49.760
understanding

00:22:45.919 --> 00:22:52.400
here allah told us about khalifa and now

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:54.640
we understand khalifa to mean steward

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:57.919
someone who carries that responsibility

00:22:54.640 --> 00:23:00.080
so in the same area allah is telling us

00:22:57.919 --> 00:23:04.080
that the khalifa said

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:04.080
or the group of khalifa said

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:10.480
we know or i know

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:13.120
things to which you were not exposed

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:15.840
knowledge that you were not given

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:18.320
evidence-based knowledge that you don't

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:20.400
have he's addressing of course

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:22.720
al-ba'auda who spoke in these two parts

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:24.880
right here so the steward said i have

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:27.120
been given evidence-based knowledge that

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:29.679
you do not have in other words there

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:31.760
shall be continuously new knowledge that

00:23:29.679 --> 00:23:34.159
comes from allah

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:36.320
when permitted by allah so this is not

00:23:34.159 --> 00:23:40.240
just a simple dialogue this is a

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:42.720
declaration by allah that everyone who

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:45.760
takes the role of stewardship being the

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:48.400
khalifa will continuously receive new

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:51.840
knowledge from allah and this new

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:55.360
knowledge will be superior and dominant

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:58.799
and extends beyond what prior people

00:23:55.360 --> 00:24:00.799
have learned so now i wanna take you to

00:23:58.799 --> 00:24:02.640
bullet number one so that we can

00:24:00.799 --> 00:24:04.960
understand exactly

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:07.200
how this is going to be applicable to us

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:10.880
so here allah subhanahu wa in surat

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.880
al-araf is telling us

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:23.360
i'm not going to be able to translate

00:24:21.279 --> 00:24:27.320
all of the yet i just want to focus on

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:31.520
one specific expression statement that

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:34.000
allah told us through the speech of nur

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.000
he says

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:47.520
i deliver the messages of my lord and i

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:49.039
advise you or i give you advice and

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:50.000
allah

00:24:49.039 --> 00:24:52.559
i know

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:57.559
knowledge delivered to me by allah

00:24:52.559 --> 00:24:57.559
remember all knowledge comes from allah

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:04.799
is in control of all

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:08.080
all the coffers of knowledge and he

00:25:04.799 --> 00:25:10.559
gives us or he gives whomever he selects

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:12.559
amounts of knowledge appropriate and

00:25:10.559 --> 00:25:15.919
commensurate with their station and

00:25:12.559 --> 00:25:18.000
their relationship with allah or for

00:25:15.919 --> 00:25:20.480
different purposes that allah chooses

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.960
and he knows and sometimes we don't know

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:24.799
why allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala provides

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:27.200
more knowledge to this person or that

00:25:24.799 --> 00:25:30.000
person allah knows wisdom belongs to

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:32.559
allah subhana with allah but we can

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.679
confirm based on what the quran says

00:25:32.559 --> 00:25:38.559
that this adam this adam nur in this

00:25:35.679 --> 00:25:38.559
case said

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:44.400
i have evidence-based knowledge

00:25:41.679 --> 00:25:46.400
that you do not have so do we have more

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:50.000
references or more evidence from the

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:52.799
quran of course in surah yusuf allah is

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.200
reporting to us what yakub said to his

00:25:52.799 --> 00:25:55.200
children

00:26:02.799 --> 00:26:09.440
that you do not have and therefore this

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:09.440
expression this expression

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:14.720
is an expression used by multiple

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:16.559
messengers or multiple prophets so

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.880
therefore when we go

00:26:16.559 --> 00:26:22.400
back to the story

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:26.159
of adam in ayah number 230 it is the

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:29.200
khalifa speaking saying i know i have

00:26:26.159 --> 00:26:31.520
some knowledge that you

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:34.000
do not have and i hope this makes it

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:36.480
clear so what did we learn here why did

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.279
i make a point of giving you an

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:41.840
incomplete translation an incoherent

00:26:39.279 --> 00:26:44.480
translation first and then came back to

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:47.840
correct it because i wanted to stress a

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:49.440
very important issue the issue is

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:52.080
phenomenally important to the

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:54.000
methodology we will go and learn a

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.799
little bit more about this with gift

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.600
number one so i hope you stay awake and

00:26:56.799 --> 00:27:02.240
focused and learn from this gift insha

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:04.559
allah so let's go to gift number one so

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:08.000
that we can understand something brand

00:27:04.559 --> 00:27:10.559
new never before exposed about how to

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.120
engage and interpret the quran gift

00:27:10.559 --> 00:27:17.120
number one deals with what is called the

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:19.039
sunk cost cognitive bias big words but

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:22.399
just be patient and you will understand

00:27:19.039 --> 00:27:26.080
how simple it is the concept of the sunk

00:27:22.399 --> 00:27:28.720
cost cognitive bias basically says

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:30.880
that when you invest in something

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:34.320
let's say you invest in a stock in a

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:36.640
company stock or you invest in a store

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:39.360
and it turns out that that store or that

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:42.320
business or that factory is really not

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:44.240
producing profits like you expected and

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:46.559
then you keep hoping and you keep

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:49.440
promising yourself that maybe next month

00:27:46.559 --> 00:27:51.279
or next quarter or next year that

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:54.240
business will do better and you keep

00:27:51.279 --> 00:27:57.840
investing while adding to your losses

00:27:54.240 --> 00:28:01.200
that is called sunk cost you keep hoping

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:04.320
and you're reluctant to stop your losses

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:07.120
you're reluctant to cancel the project

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:10.640
to eliminate your investments to accept

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:13.840
your losses and move on that refusal to

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:15.919
accept the losses to accept reality that

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:18.480
you've made a mistake in your decision

00:28:15.919 --> 00:28:21.760
to open that business is called the sunk

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:25.840
cost cognitive bias so your bias toward

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:29.679
optimism your bias toward accepting what

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:32.159
you have already invested in as must win

00:28:29.679 --> 00:28:35.039
must succeed and therefore you keep

00:28:32.159 --> 00:28:37.679
thinking no next week next month it will

00:28:35.039 --> 00:28:40.240
be better you keep being optimistic

00:28:37.679 --> 00:28:42.960
all along you're really making more

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:46.480
investments and thus more losses there

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:48.720
is a resistance to stop the loss to

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:52.000
admit that you've made a mistake and

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:54.720
work backward now why is this so

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.120
important to the methodology this is so

00:28:54.720 --> 00:29:00.720
important to the methodology because it

00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:03.679
represents a cognitive bias in all human

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:05.279
beings remember when we talked about the

00:29:03.679 --> 00:29:07.840
concept of

00:29:05.279 --> 00:29:10.640
confirmation bias that you enter into

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:12.799
the quran thinking already something and

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:15.120
then you start finding evidence that

00:29:12.799 --> 00:29:19.039
points you that wants to prove

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:22.240
what you thought pre-assumed is correct

00:29:19.039 --> 00:29:24.240
those are the types of biases that keep

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:26.600
you away from

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:29.840
presenting an empty cup to learn from

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:32.320
allah so the example i want to use here

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:34.480
is that you made some investment in the

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:37.279
interpretation you've made some

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:40.159
investment in the tafsir or the

00:29:37.279 --> 00:29:42.720
translation and then you keep going page

00:29:40.159 --> 00:29:45.039
after page after page and then at the

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:46.880
bottom of a certain surah you discover

00:29:45.039 --> 00:29:49.600
hey i made a mistake

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:52.559
how many of us are willing to throw away

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:55.200
everything we've done and start fresh in

00:29:52.559 --> 00:29:57.200
other words empty our cup fully to

00:29:55.200 --> 00:30:00.320
relearn again based on what we

00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:02.240
discovered at the bottom of a certain

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:04.720
surah i'm going to give you an example

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:08.159
that happened to me i invested couple of

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:11.120
months interpreting surat use of before

00:30:08.159 --> 00:30:12.960
i got to ayan number one or two i'm

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:16.720
gonna go to the example before coming

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:19.120
back to the theoretical stuff aya 102

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:23.760
which is toward the end of surah usa

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:26.799
surah yusuf has 111 ayat so aya 102 is

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:28.559
about 10 ayat before the end i've

00:30:26.799 --> 00:30:30.880
already worked through the whole surah

00:30:28.559 --> 00:30:33.760
in accordance with the traditional

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:36.880
interpretation i thought i knew surah

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:39.520
yusuf i thought i knew the story i have

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:42.480
learned it and taught it for 20 years

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:43.440
but then when i came to this area i had

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:46.159
to be

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:47.760
honest with myself i had to submit to

00:30:46.159 --> 00:30:50.480
allah

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:54.559
and see with my own eyes what this ayah

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:54.559
is saying this area is saying

00:30:56.799 --> 00:31:03.039
this information this story of uses that

00:30:59.519 --> 00:31:06.320
we just recounted for you in this surah

00:31:03.039 --> 00:31:10.720
is a partial account of the truth

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:12.960
which is currently beyond perception

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:16.080
in other words at the time this surah

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:19.360
was revealed to prophet muhammed

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:21.919
no one knew this type of information and

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:24.480
this ayah is telling me as i was doing

00:31:21.919 --> 00:31:27.679
the interpretation and the translation

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:30.399
that it cannot be the story that matches

00:31:27.679 --> 00:31:31.440
the story of joseph in the bible in

00:31:30.399 --> 00:31:32.799
genesis

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.919
it cannot be

00:31:32.799 --> 00:31:36.159
therefore

00:31:33.919 --> 00:31:37.519
this single area

00:31:36.159 --> 00:31:39.919
annulled

00:31:37.519 --> 00:31:43.000
eliminated all the work i had done for a

00:31:39.919 --> 00:31:46.480
couple of months in translating the

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:49.440
101 ayat that came before it

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:51.279
so i had a dilemma what do i do do i

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:53.279
dismiss this area

00:31:51.279 --> 00:31:55.840
or do i eliminate everything that i've

00:31:53.279 --> 00:31:56.880
done throw it in the trash and start

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:59.039
fresh

00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:01.679
that's exactly what i did when you make

00:31:59.039 --> 00:32:03.360
that decision for the sake of allah

00:32:01.679 --> 00:32:06.000
having that courage

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:08.799
to tell yourself you've made a mistake

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.919
you need to start again allah will

00:32:08.799 --> 00:32:12.880
support you

00:32:09.919 --> 00:32:15.679
will sustain your sincerity will give

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:16.640
you the strength to keep finding the

00:32:15.679 --> 00:32:18.960
truth

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:20.880
from different perspectives this is

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:23.919
exactly what happened with surah yusuf

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:25.519
alhamdulillah what i've reached with the

00:32:23.919 --> 00:32:27.200
new understanding and the new

00:32:25.519 --> 00:32:29.600
interpretation of surah

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:31.679
which insha allah we will publish soon

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:34.320
is amazing it's phenomenal it's totally

00:32:31.679 --> 00:32:35.360
different than the stories that are told

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:37.679
to us

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:40.399
in all the books of tafsir and that have

00:32:37.679 --> 00:32:42.000
been imported from the sources of the

00:32:40.399 --> 00:32:44.559
corrupted versions of the earlier

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.200
scriptures such as the torah so this is

00:32:44.559 --> 00:32:49.200
exactly what the sun cost cognitive bias

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:52.080
is all about in that respect this

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:53.919
cognitive bias is like the confirmation

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:57.919
bias that we've just discussed a little

00:32:53.919 --> 00:33:01.279
earlier very often the keys to resolve

00:32:57.919 --> 00:33:05.120
unanswered questions about some story or

00:33:01.279 --> 00:33:08.399
some parable come later in the surah or

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:09.519
in other ayat so as we saw for example

00:33:08.399 --> 00:33:14.279
when we

00:33:09.519 --> 00:33:14.279
interpreted ayah number 230

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:21.120
it seems like a question and then when

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:21.120
we saw another area which says

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.880
he is never questioned about anything he

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.960
does

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:31.039
the second area is clearly a

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:34.000
clarification that the first area 230 is

00:33:31.039 --> 00:33:36.640
not a question that means we need to

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.120
find the correct truth about what it

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:42.000
means and we discovered that it's the

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:44.480
locution of al-bawdah and their habits

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.640
and their styles of asking interrogative

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:48.919
questions while in reality they're

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:53.120
making a challenging declaration so

00:33:48.919 --> 00:33:56.000
allah teaches us if we accept that

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:58.000
everything in the quran is the truth and

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.519
everything should be relevant there is

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:04.159
full congruence in the quran so if allah

00:34:01.519 --> 00:34:05.679
is telling us the story i just told you

00:34:04.159 --> 00:34:09.359
has been raib

00:34:05.679 --> 00:34:11.599
undisclosed before to anyone living at

00:34:09.359 --> 00:34:13.599
the time we have to accept that that

00:34:11.599 --> 00:34:16.240
means it is not the story coming from

00:34:13.599 --> 00:34:19.119
the bible it is not the story of joseph

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:21.119
coming from the book of genesis

00:34:19.119 --> 00:34:22.079
and therefore when we continue with the

00:34:21.119 --> 00:34:24.159
surah

00:34:22.079 --> 00:34:26.879
often we discover

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:29.599
facts and information that are at the

00:34:26.879 --> 00:34:32.480
bottom of the story or after the story

00:34:29.599 --> 00:34:34.320
that really explain and elucidate some

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:35.359
facts about the story itself i hope it's

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.359
clear

00:34:35.359 --> 00:34:39.839
so

00:34:36.359 --> 00:34:41.280
allah sets us up

00:34:39.839 --> 00:34:44.800
specifically

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:45.919
for the sunk cost cognitive bias he

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:48.320
knows

00:34:45.919 --> 00:34:50.720
so if your assumption is that what

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:53.119
you've already discovered must be true

00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:56.079
and you're not willing to give it up

00:34:53.119 --> 00:34:59.079
you're not willing to unlearn

00:34:56.079 --> 00:35:01.839
you're not willing to relearn

00:34:59.079 --> 00:35:04.400
allah has caught you in a trap in your

00:35:01.839 --> 00:35:07.359
own trap the trap is not from allah the

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:09.520
trap is your own cognitive bias is there

00:35:07.359 --> 00:35:11.359
any evidence any methodological

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:13.119
instructions to this you're going to be

00:35:11.359 --> 00:35:15.599
amazed and this is the beauty of this

00:35:13.119 --> 00:35:16.720
gift that has never been exposed to you

00:35:15.599 --> 00:35:19.200
before

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:21.760
so this is especially true for stories

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:24.720
that yet that follow a story often

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:27.440
provide clues and keys to resolve

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:29.920
ambiguities within the stories i have

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:31.839
dozens of such examples and insha allah

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:34.400
in the right time we will reveal many

00:35:31.839 --> 00:35:36.480
many many examples like that but i will

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:39.280
reveal to you the methodological

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:43.520
instructions clearly provided in surat

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:45.040
assafet this is surah number 37 i'm not

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:47.119
gonna translate the whole surah we're

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:50.720
only gonna translate and deal with the

00:35:47.119 --> 00:35:54.320
first five yet so the first ayah says

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:54.320
wasa fatis often

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.720
fatality

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.359
i swear by those by the way it does not

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:14.160
say those what

00:36:11.359 --> 00:36:16.800
it is given in the form of feminine

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:19.359
plural feminine plural he's talking

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:22.160
about something plural in the sense of

00:36:19.359 --> 00:36:25.599
feminine and this could apply to any

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:28.400
object so in the case of this area as

00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:31.359
you will see this is relevant or this is

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:34.560
applicable to the ayat of the quran the

00:36:31.359 --> 00:36:37.280
actual text ayat of the quran i swear by

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:38.839
those ayat that line up in a special

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:41.599
type of alignment

00:36:38.839 --> 00:36:44.480
allah has caused them to follow each

00:36:41.599 --> 00:36:47.960
other in a very peculiar sequence the

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:51.599
sequence from allah is so unique that

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:52.839
allah is swearing by that sequence by

00:36:51.599 --> 00:36:56.079
that special

00:36:52.839 --> 00:36:57.440
alignment and by those i yet that thus

00:36:56.079 --> 00:36:59.760
admonish

00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:02.560
against misinterpretation in their own

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:06.960
way of admonishment so when i saw aya

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:08.560
102 from sura uses it is an admonishment

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:11.040
it told me

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:13.599
you've already made a mistake be willing

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:16.320
to throw it away and start again this is

00:37:13.599 --> 00:37:18.800
an admonishment this is a warning a

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:21.520
wake-up call to remind me

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:23.440
that don't just trust your mind and your

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:26.560
own comfort level

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:29.119
follow what allah is teaching you so if

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:31.920
after you've done a job your boss comes

00:37:29.119 --> 00:37:34.640
and tells you what you've done is all to

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:36.960
be trashed you would trust your your

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:40.800
boss you have to trash what you've done

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:42.880
and start again so allah teaches us that

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:45.599
after you read the story if you go to

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:47.839
the bottom after the story itself very

00:37:45.599 --> 00:37:50.960
often you're going to find some

00:37:47.839 --> 00:37:53.200
elucidating information if you don't pay

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:55.200
attention to this elucidation you're

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:57.440
likely to have made a mistake in

00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:00.320
interpreting the story itself

00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:03.680
so we will continue

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:06.480
and thus this ayat admonish us against

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:08.400
misinterpretation in their own way of

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:10.400
admonishment you have to pay attention

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:13.119
this is what we keep saying we have you

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:15.760
have to be alert you have to be

00:38:13.119 --> 00:38:19.400
fully there interpreting the ayat and

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:19.400
learning from the ayah

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:30.400
in the sequence in the alignment

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:32.079
after the

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:33.680
this is exactly what we're saying so

00:38:32.079 --> 00:38:36.480
allah

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:38.079
sets us up by giving us some

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:41.599
clarifications

00:38:38.079 --> 00:38:43.920
after the story not before why because

00:38:41.599 --> 00:38:45.839
he wants to test you he wants to make

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:47.440
sure that you are going to put in the

00:38:45.839 --> 00:38:49.520
discipline you're going to be

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:53.599
disciplined in the interpretation of the

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:53.599
story and this is what we keep saying

00:38:53.839 --> 00:38:58.880
the discipline that corrects you that

00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:00.720
allows you to self-correct

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:02.640
this is what we're talking about and

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:04.800
this is one of the principles and this

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:07.359
is one of the gift that we share with

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:10.320
you on this channel it's called the sunk

00:39:07.359 --> 00:39:13.200
cost cognitive bias it is taught to us

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:14.880
in surat al-safat a surah that is

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:16.400
seemingly talking about something

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:18.160
totally different if you read the

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:20.480
interpretation and if you read the

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:23.040
translations they're all over the place

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:27.359
because they cannot figure out what this

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:29.440
specific area number three fatality

00:39:27.359 --> 00:39:30.880
we interpreted it alhamdulillah in the

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:34.160
right way and it

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:36.640
and its evidence is everywhere whenever

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:39.040
you read a story you keep following

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:41.920
after the story you find some clues and

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:43.920
hints and keys that are extremely

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:46.079
essential for you

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:48.960
to follow the admonishment that allah

00:39:46.079 --> 00:39:53.760
subhanahu wa'ta'ala is giving us in this

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:53.760
ayah and then surah asafat continues

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:58.320
your lord is one

00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:01.440
what does that mean that means all of

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:04.160
these stories must be coherent congruent

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:07.119
consistent relevant to each other

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:09.200
pertinent in how the details fit with

00:40:07.119 --> 00:40:11.680
each other there are no contradictions

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:15.440
because they come from the same source

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:18.079
one lord the lord of assam await the

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:20.319
layers of understanding and

00:40:18.079 --> 00:40:22.640
the scripture and everything between

00:40:20.319 --> 00:40:24.720
them all of the intermediate stages you

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:25.680
go through even some of them may be

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:28.880
wrong

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:31.680
and then you learn again

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:33.359
and the lord of all the risings of

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:36.160
messengers we've talked about the

00:40:33.359 --> 00:40:38.960
concept of mushrik when we talked about

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:40.560
the story of dulcarne if you remember go

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:42.560
back to that series and watch that

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:44.400
series if you're really interested in

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:47.000
the plural

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:50.000
many risings many messengers sent by

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.079
allah as i said there are many many

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000
other examples inshallah in future

00:40:52.079 --> 00:40:56.560
segments we will talk about

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.880
various examples related to various

00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:02.480
stories so with this we go back to the

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:06.160
ayat ayah number 230 and here we said

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:08.800
that adam is constantly saying i know

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:10.319
that which you don't know now i want you

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.920
to pay attention

00:41:10.319 --> 00:41:15.280
who is you

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:16.560
everybody who came before allah is

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:19.359
constantly

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:22.560
selecting new khalifa giving that

00:41:19.359 --> 00:41:24.960
khalifa more information than those who

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:26.560
came before this is a sunnah of allah

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:28.200
subhana wa

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:31.920
this is the way of

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:34.560
allah in selecting khalifa khalifa in

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:37.040
what khalifa in the scripture

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:38.960
steward over the scripture does that

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:40.560
apply to us

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:43.760
i need you to answer this question

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:46.560
honestly of course it does the scripture

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:49.359
is a creation from allah

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:52.240
an instrument through which we receive

00:41:49.359 --> 00:41:55.200
more and more and more information

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:58.079
does that mean that what is said on this

00:41:55.200 --> 00:42:00.400
channel today as you're hearing it is

00:41:58.079 --> 00:42:01.440
going to be perfect forever of course

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:05.119
not

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:08.560
because allah may have withheld some

00:42:05.119 --> 00:42:11.280
knowledge from dr hani but you or your

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:14.400
son or your grandson inshaallah will

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:16.960
engage the same ayat and will extract

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:20.160
more information and more knowledge with

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:21.920
the help of allah and therefore

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:25.520
no one should say

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:28.160
that only a certain generation or two

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:31.040
generations or three generation of

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:32.400
rightly guided self are the ones who

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:36.400
know the truth

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:38.560
this is bogus this is be lying this ayat

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:40.480
khalifa khalifa

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:43.920
is always saying

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:46.240
i know that which you do not know why

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:47.520
because knowledge is from allah

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:50.400
subhanallah

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:52.560
and this is gift number two that i want

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:54.640
to share with you right here the concept

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:56.160
of khalifa

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:58.800
stewardship

00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:01.280
applies to all generations

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:06.800
all generations have the right to say

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:06.800
what al-khalifa in ayah number 230 said

00:43:07.599 --> 00:43:13.119
i know that which you do not know

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:15.520
does this apply to our beloved

00:43:13.119 --> 00:43:17.599
sallallahu alaihi wasallam

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:19.680
we don't know because we did not receive

00:43:17.599 --> 00:43:22.480
everything he was taught

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:25.119
we were not told everything muhammad

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:27.520
sallallahu alaihi wasallam was taught

00:43:25.119 --> 00:43:29.440
we don't know how much he was given how

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:34.319
much he was not given

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:36.560
but for sure if allah expects me and you

00:43:34.319 --> 00:43:39.359
and then later our children and

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:42.240
generations to come after to become

00:43:39.359 --> 00:43:45.119
stewards over this scripture then for

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:47.119
sure allah will establish his promise to

00:43:45.119 --> 00:43:51.400
give them additional knowledge with

00:43:47.119 --> 00:43:55.040
every successive alternating generation

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:57.520
allah promised this and therefore anyone

00:43:55.040 --> 00:44:01.920
who claims that the knowledge about the

00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:04.560
scripture is epitomized is perfect

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:07.599
for those who came during the first

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:08.400
three generations is lying about the

00:44:07.599 --> 00:44:10.160
quran

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:13.280
is saying something directly

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:17.440
contradicting the quran as we just said

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:20.240
they are believing what allah said as we

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:24.000
saw in this ayat so now we go back to

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:25.760
ayah number 231 231 we've covered this

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.160
before i'm just going to go over it very

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:28.160
quickly

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:32.880
allah taught adam in this case muhammad

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:37.040
sallallahu alaihi

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:38.160
the labels the locution which locution

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:41.680
all of them

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:44.319
the quranic locution as well as the

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:47.800
locution of those who corrupted the

00:44:44.319 --> 00:44:51.800
scripture before meaning the earlier

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:51.800
allah confirmed

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:57.200
we explained this in full detail last

00:44:55.119 --> 00:45:00.319
time i'm just reviewing some basic

00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:02.720
information here with you and then allah

00:45:00.319 --> 00:45:05.599
subjected all of them

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:07.520
as well as the stewards to be judged in

00:45:05.599 --> 00:45:09.920
accordance with the standards given

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:12.240
through the angels meaning the quran the

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:15.560
quran being the last revelation to

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:18.240
mankind the full complete preserved

00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:22.160
unadulterated collection of all the

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:24.720
instructions from allah through which we

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:26.960
use to receive the knowledge remember

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:30.160
al-quran is an instrument is not a book

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:30.160
of poetry and then

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:38.079
it was adam meaning prophet muhammed

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:40.160
using the quran following the

00:45:38.079 --> 00:45:41.520
instructions in the quran

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:44.319
challenging

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:46.480
everyone including the bauda tell me the

00:45:44.319 --> 00:45:48.319
labels meaning the locution or the

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:51.040
divine lexicon

00:45:48.319 --> 00:45:53.839
of these angels who brought the quran if

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:56.640
you are truthful in control saudi green

00:45:53.839 --> 00:45:58.400
we explained this in full last time and

00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:00.720
now we're fully up to date on the

00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:02.880
translation there is one more concept

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:06.000
that i want to introduce to you before

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:08.160
we proceed to iaf 32 and 33 we have not

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.400
been able to cover it before i want to

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:13.119
sort of elucidate it a little bit and

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:16.880
give you a quick answer so we can keep

00:46:13.119 --> 00:46:19.119
moving on the word ambi uni last time i

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:21.920
translated it as tell

00:46:19.119 --> 00:46:25.040
with a code mark around it

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:26.960
anytime i use this type of code mark

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:28.560
make sure you understand this is not a

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:30.560
perfect translation this is not a

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:32.880
perfect interpretation there's more

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:35.280
detail but i want to avoid a lot of

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:37.359
details for the sake of time or because

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:39.599
we have not touched on that concept

00:46:37.359 --> 00:46:43.319
right now we're going to touch on that

00:46:39.599 --> 00:46:43.319
concept so allah

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:10.560
so here i highlighted some yellow and

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:12.720
some green because we have something

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:13.760
peculiar that deserves really close

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:15.680
attention

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:18.640
first you need to notice that everything

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:21.680
in yellow is the exact same verb in the

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:21.680
same morpheme

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.839
this is the verb nabet

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:31.440
all of these three verbs are exactly the

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:34.000
same verb

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:36.559
whereas the one in green

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.960
is a different verb a different form of

00:47:36.559 --> 00:47:41.040
the same gerund if you will but it means

00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:43.599
something different remember every time

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:45.680
we change the morpheme or we add

00:47:43.599 --> 00:47:48.720
something to the gerund we change the

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:50.400
meaning this is the way arabic works the

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:52.079
gerund is the same it's about

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:56.079
information it's about sharing

00:47:52.079 --> 00:47:59.599
information but in the case of green and

00:47:56.079 --> 00:47:59.599
it means something different than

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:05.920
so what is this talking about

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:08.400
to give you a quick review of how the

00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:11.040
interpreters and by definition all of

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:13.520
the translators dealt with this they

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:15.680
were confused all over the place i'm

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:17.920
sorry this is kind of small but i'm

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:20.400
going to put it on the screen so you can

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:21.359
see it and so that you can review it by

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:24.000
yourself

00:48:21.359 --> 00:48:25.920
all of these translators refer to the

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:29.599
yellow verb

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:32.640
using sometimes different words so in

00:48:29.599 --> 00:48:36.000
the case of pixol one time he used

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:38.640
divulged one time he used told her one

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:42.079
time he used told me in the case of

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:45.359
yusuf ali divulged told told

00:48:42.079 --> 00:48:47.280
in the case of shakur she informed she

00:48:45.359 --> 00:48:50.480
informed she informed so he was

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:53.200
consistent and so on but in many other

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:55.680
cases they were inconsistent in

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:58.160
translating the verb

00:48:55.680 --> 00:49:00.400
and the problem is when they could when

00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:04.000
they translated

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:06.319
they also used a inconsistent

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.040
translation i'm only bringing this to

00:49:06.319 --> 00:49:12.480
your attention for you to pay attention

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:14.160
for you to really notice that some of

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:16.480
these translations are really

00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:19.200
inconsistent they're not based on a

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:22.800
methodology they're not based on a

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:25.440
strict disciplined way to assign the

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:28.000
right meaning to the right word and this

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:30.079
is also true in the books of tafsir

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.440
unfortunately so what is the summary

00:49:30.079 --> 00:49:34.000
what are we talking about what's the

00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:35.839
difference between

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.720
and

00:49:35.839 --> 00:49:40.960
so if you study the full quran with all

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:42.559
of the ayat that used

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:44.160
versus

00:49:42.559 --> 00:49:45.680
you find the following and i'm only

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:48.720
going to give you the summary so we can

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:51.599
move on with the rest of the segment

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:53.760
refers to a human type of knowledge

00:49:51.599 --> 00:49:56.800
human type of information about

00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:56.800
something in the past

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:08.400
or prophet prophesizing future events

00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:10.640
is a verb that relates to future matters

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:11.280
so in this ayah the prophet sallallahu

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:14.480
alaihi

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:16.720
relayed to some of his as was we will

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:19.760
see what that meaning insha allah is in

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:23.760
the next segment hadithan some sort of a

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:23.760
discourse some sort of information

00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:29.200
now we are told that this information

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:31.599
muhammad sallallahu sallam gave

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:34.400
to some of his as

00:50:31.599 --> 00:50:38.240
was as was about something pertinent to

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:41.520
the future so she foretold it to other

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:44.000
people so she talked about this hadith

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:46.160
this foretold information to other

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:49.040
people in other words she shared the

00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:52.240
secret that allah gave to muhammad

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:54.559
sallam and he shared with her

00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:58.480
she shared that secret with other people

00:50:54.559 --> 00:51:01.200
so she wanted to pretend that she knows

00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:04.400
the future not that this is the problem

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:07.119
with this person but muhammad sallam had

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:10.640
known about this

00:51:07.119 --> 00:51:13.280
he foretold her that she did this

00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:16.400
in other words allah had already told

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:19.599
him that she was going to do this and he

00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:22.720
explained this to her but he overlooked

00:51:19.599 --> 00:51:24.720
some other parts her answer is who told

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:26.880
you that i did this in other words she

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:28.800
used the verb that refers to human

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:31.680
knowledge about the past

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:33.680
she's asking him who

00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:36.559
who tattled on me

00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:39.599
who told you what i did

00:51:36.559 --> 00:51:43.040
and then allah continues telling us what

00:51:39.599 --> 00:51:43.040
muhammad sallallahu alaihi said

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:47.599
allah has foretold me that you're going

00:51:46.319 --> 00:51:50.400
to do this

00:51:47.599 --> 00:51:52.800
so in other words allah instructed

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:55.599
muhammad sallallahu sallam to share some

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:57.280
information with some as waj we will see

00:51:55.599 --> 00:52:00.400
what that means

00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:02.319
and allah subhanahu wa ta'ala made sure

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:04.960
that some of this information is not

00:52:02.319 --> 00:52:08.319
really that secret that critical to the

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:10.800
mission of our beloved salem and that

00:52:08.319 --> 00:52:13.760
person who received the information

00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:16.000
failed in preserving the secrets this is

00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:19.200
what this area is about it has nothing

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:21.040
to do with the wives tales that we heard

00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:24.720
about in the interpretation in the books

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:26.880
of tafsir about this wife or that wife

00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:29.760
or this concubine who slept in this

00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:32.800
person's bed or none of that stuff it

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:34.480
has nothing to do with all of this bogus

00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:37.440
stuff that we were told in the books of

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:39.760
tafsir allah is teaching us the

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:44.240
difference between the various verbs or

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:47.119
the various forms of the same verb

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:51.599
why is this so important because if we

00:52:47.119 --> 00:52:51.599
go back to the area where we talk about

00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:59.440
muhammad sallam or adam is challenging

00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:02.000
other human beings to give me your human

00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:04.240
knowledge that you've had in the past in

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:06.240
other words you're saying you know and

00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:08.800
muhammad being the khalifa is telling

00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:11.680
them i know more than you do

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:14.079
now he's challenging them okay if you

00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:16.240
have that knowledge from your past give

00:53:14.079 --> 00:53:19.119
me this knowledge and what it means what

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:21.599
it indicates with respect to the quran

00:53:19.119 --> 00:53:24.000
ambi uni based on your past knowledge

00:53:21.599 --> 00:53:26.640
based on your human knowledge he's not

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.880
saying neb uni give me the future

00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:32.079
expectations he's telling them give me

00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:34.160
your past information that proves

00:53:32.079 --> 00:53:37.119
in control the queen that proves that

00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:43.640
you are truthful of course they failed

00:53:37.119 --> 00:53:43.640
so now we move to aya number 232 and 233

00:53:45.119 --> 00:53:48.559
they

00:53:46.079 --> 00:53:51.280
i will come back to this one said

00:53:48.559 --> 00:53:53.680
oh allah we follow but your way no

00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:55.839
knowledge do we possess except that

00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:57.599
which you have taught us of course the

00:53:55.839 --> 00:54:00.240
word knowledge is evidence-based

00:53:57.599 --> 00:54:03.359
knowledge but in this case we have three

00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:05.680
groups involved we have the ba'auda

00:54:03.359 --> 00:54:07.760
because they are in the context

00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:09.359
we have khalifa

00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:11.520
the stewards

00:54:09.359 --> 00:54:13.760
and we have the angels which we've

00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:16.319
talked about in the ayah before and the

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:16.319
universe

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:23.119
is the language or the locution of the

00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:25.520
angels so in this case we have three

00:54:23.119 --> 00:54:27.440
groups speaking in one ayah and i will

00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:30.000
detail it in just one second i want to

00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:33.040
complete the translation indeed you

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:35.920
allah are the one who teaches and you

00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:38.799
are the source of linguistic discernment

00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:41.599
now why am i saying three groups let's

00:54:38.799 --> 00:54:44.960
go to note set number three so that we

00:54:41.599 --> 00:54:46.400
can elaborate fully why i believe all

00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:49.839
three are speaking

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:52.400
so the khalifa the stewards are saying

00:54:49.839 --> 00:54:55.680
we submit that true evidence-based

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:58.880
knowledge comes only from you

00:54:55.680 --> 00:55:00.720
we submit that the knowledge from allah

00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:02.799
the true evidence-based knowledge

00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:04.160
especially about the scripture comes

00:55:02.799 --> 00:55:05.839
from allah

00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:08.400
this is the first group the second group

00:55:05.839 --> 00:55:11.040
the angels of course they say we only

00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:14.319
recognize the labels that you have

00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:16.720
taught us you have programmed us to

00:55:14.319 --> 00:55:20.319
accept only that locution that

00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:23.280
vocabulary that lexicon the angels say

00:55:20.319 --> 00:55:26.400
this and they also say subhanaka we

00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:29.040
follow your way of course so two groups

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:31.760
is very clear the third group is less

00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:34.480
clear but it is consistent with what we

00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:37.040
saw earlier at

00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:40.319
the ba'uda said something slightly more

00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:42.000
sneaky and more harmful they said

00:55:40.319 --> 00:55:44.640
what we have learned

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:47.440
we have learned from you allah and

00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:49.280
therefore since we don't recognize what

00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:52.640
muhammad brought

00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:53.920
it must be not from allah pay attention

00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:56.160
they're saying

00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:59.040
we know the knowledge from allah they're

00:55:56.160 --> 00:56:00.319
already presuming themselves to be the

00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:03.680
authority

00:56:00.319 --> 00:56:06.640
they're presuming to be dominant over

00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:08.960
what muhammad brought

00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:11.280
i want you to think about this there are

00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:13.920
a lot of stories in sira

00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:16.559
and a lot of stories in the hadith

00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:18.079
and a lot of stories in the tafsir

00:56:16.559 --> 00:56:20.640
telling us

00:56:18.079 --> 00:56:21.839
that the torah is the authority over the

00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:24.480
quran

00:56:21.839 --> 00:56:26.960
that the people of the torah know this

00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:29.520
knowledge and therefore they would know

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:32.520
if what muhammad brought in the quran is

00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:35.760
true or not

00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:37.920
allah is teaching us this is their style

00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:39.040
of proclaiming themselves to be the

00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:40.559
authority

00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:42.960
i want you to think about what that

00:56:40.559 --> 00:56:45.040
means about the content of the seerah

00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:48.079
and the content of the books of tafseer

00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:51.599
and the content of some of the hadith

00:56:48.079 --> 00:56:52.720
which confirm that the earlier recipient

00:56:51.599 --> 00:56:56.280
of

00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:59.520
kitab know more about these stories

00:56:56.280 --> 00:57:00.799
allah is teaching us they're sneaky in

00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:03.599
their claim

00:57:00.799 --> 00:57:05.040
they're making themselves the authority

00:57:03.599 --> 00:57:08.079
instead of allah

00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:12.000
they presumed to be in the role of

00:57:08.079 --> 00:57:14.400
judgment over muhammad

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:16.000
that what we were taught or not

00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:18.400
of course it was

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.839
but allah is teaching us

00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:23.359
that

00:57:19.839 --> 00:57:25.839
wrongly placed themselves in the role of

00:57:23.359 --> 00:57:28.160
judgment over

00:57:25.839 --> 00:57:30.960
why do we say that

00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:33.920
is speaking also remember there's a rule

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:35.520
in the quran whenever a continuation of

00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:38.079
the same discourse

00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:40.160
is broken into a separate ayah that

00:57:38.079 --> 00:57:43.119
means something changed that means it's

00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:45.680
not part of the same scene anymore it's

00:57:43.119 --> 00:57:49.599
not part of the same group speaking so

00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:51.760
remember in the ayah 231 adam is telling

00:57:49.599 --> 00:57:51.760
them

00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:58.960
now there's another area that says a

00:57:56.720 --> 00:58:01.200
group of people are speaking in this

00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:04.640
case there's something changed it is not

00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:09.839
the same people who are addressed in 231

00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:09.839
so now we continue with a number 233

00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:18.640
he allah said o adam

00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:23.839
meaning muhammad inform them or disclose

00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:23.839
to them using their concocted labels

00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:30.400
when muhammad or adam in this case

00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:34.000
reported what he knew to them using

00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:36.720
their labels and remember amba is about

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:40.559
human information relating to the past

00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:43.280
he did so by saying i did not tell you i

00:58:40.559 --> 00:58:46.000
know the undisclosed of the layers of

00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:48.640
understanding and in the scripture and

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:51.680
as you see i know what you declare and

00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:53.119
what you use to hide hey hey hey where's

00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:54.400
the question mark

00:58:53.119 --> 00:58:56.559
alam

00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:59.280
there's a question mark ah

00:58:56.559 --> 00:59:01.839
he's using their locution muhammad is

00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:05.440
using their locution their locution

00:59:01.839 --> 00:59:08.480
presumes that they ask question in

00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:09.760
sneaky ways and rhetorical interrogative

00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:12.480
statements

00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:14.640
that are meant to confirm something that

00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:18.880
are meant to tell them

00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:21.359
that i know how you speak esme him watch

00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:25.359
this when muhammad sallallahu asallam

00:59:21.359 --> 00:59:28.319
reported what he knew to them he did so

00:59:25.359 --> 00:59:31.599
by saying

00:59:28.319 --> 00:59:34.280
he did so he said while using their

00:59:31.599 --> 00:59:37.520
labels while using their locution so

00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:40.240
allah is teaching us that muhammad was

00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:42.960
outsmarting them in the way their

00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:44.160
locution works and that should have

00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:46.960
stunned them

00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:48.079
that should have really shocked them

00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:50.480
this guy

00:59:48.079 --> 00:59:52.960
knows how we speak

00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:54.720
and this is the evidence right here how

00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:57.599
did we learn this we learned this from

00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:59.440
ayah 230.

00:59:57.599 --> 01:00:02.079
and all the evidence that we provided in

00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:05.280
that segment that discussed ayat 230. so

01:00:02.079 --> 01:00:07.200
in this case i did not tell you i know

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:08.880
the undisclosed of the layers of

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:13.280
understanding and in the scripture in

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:15.760
other words muhammad sallallahu asallah

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:19.359
i don't know right so therefore

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:22.000
where did i learn your locution your

01:00:19.359 --> 01:00:25.520
concocted labels and the continuation of

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:28.880
the i approves it and as you see meaning

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:30.960
i present myself as you see

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:34.000
knowing what you declare and what you

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:36.799
use to hide even the secrets of how you

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:40.640
speak among each other this is reminding

01:00:36.799 --> 01:00:42.640
us of how isa talked to beni israel the

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:45.680
same exact situation

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:47.839
and how musa spoke to beni israel the

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:51.440
same exact situation using their

01:00:47.839 --> 01:00:54.160
locution so allah is expressing to us

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:56.559
that muhammad said so to the

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:59.520
in their style of interrogative

01:00:56.559 --> 01:01:01.680
statements and rhetorical questions i

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:05.280
hope this is clear so we saw this in

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:07.440
ayat 230 there is a question from them

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:09.599
from baoda in the form of interrogative

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:10.400
statement whereas in reality it's a

01:01:09.599 --> 01:01:14.319
challenge

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:15.200
here muhammad sallam is ordered by allah

01:01:14.319 --> 01:01:17.839
and

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:19.920
report to them what you know using their

01:01:17.839 --> 01:01:23.359
style using their labels

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:25.520
and he did so by saying i did not tell

01:01:23.359 --> 01:01:27.839
you i know the undisclosed of the layers

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:30.559
of understanding and in the scripture so

01:01:27.839 --> 01:01:32.640
this is really weird i did not tell you

01:01:30.559 --> 01:01:35.440
did we see this anywhere in the quran

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:37.599
let's go to set number four in the notes

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:40.319
and you will see for yourself that this

01:01:37.599 --> 01:01:42.480
is exactly what happened so here's set

01:01:40.319 --> 01:01:44.960
number four of the notes remember we're

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:47.920
talking about adam meaning muhammad

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:51.040
sallam in this case speaking their

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:54.960
locution as a way to challenge them

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:57.839
just as musa did with beni israel before

01:01:54.960 --> 01:02:00.400
recall that in the story of dulcan our

01:01:57.839 --> 01:02:02.960
beloved sallallahu salaam gathered the

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:04.000
gatekeepers of the secrets from the two

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:06.240
groups

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.720
when he went up to tabuk there were two

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:11.839
groups of jewish tribes who were

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:14.079
gathered by muhammad sallam and they

01:02:11.839 --> 01:02:16.000
were blocking the guidance and he shared

01:02:14.079 --> 01:02:21.240
with them the details of their own

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:21.240
secret code how did he learn it allah

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:28.680
he taught him all the labels all the

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:31.920
locutions past and present now did

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:35.720
muhammad say i do not tell you of course

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:35.720
he did in s

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:50.160
i do not tell you

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:52.720
i have possession

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:54.240
of all the coffers of knowledge of

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:56.880
allah's knowledge

01:02:54.240 --> 01:03:01.200
and i do not know the undisclosed this

01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:03.520
is exactly what he said in ayah 2 33.

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:07.039
so therefore this is a perfect match

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:10.319
between that ayah and this ayah allah

01:03:07.039 --> 01:03:12.799
taught muhammad to say i do not say

01:03:10.319 --> 01:03:13.599
i do not say what was the question up

01:03:12.799 --> 01:03:15.760
here

01:03:13.599 --> 01:03:17.760
that turned into an affirmative

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:20.400
statement

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:22.319
did i not say to you meaning i did not

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:24.720
say to you

01:03:22.319 --> 01:03:25.599
i hope you see the relationship between

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:27.280
the two

01:03:25.599 --> 01:03:30.559
let's continue with the set of notes

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:33.119
number four so we go down again to notes

01:03:30.559 --> 01:03:35.520
number four i do not say to you that i

01:03:33.119 --> 01:03:38.480
possess the coffers of allah's knowledge

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:41.680
and i do not know the undisclosed and i

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:44.640
do not say to you i'm an angel i follow

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:46.640
but what is enjoined what is instructed

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:48.559
to me

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:53.599
etc with the rest of the

01:03:48.559 --> 01:03:53.599
now i am aware that the same expression

01:03:54.400 --> 01:04:00.799
occurred in ayah 11 31 which seems to

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:03.839
state the same expression at the voice

01:04:00.799 --> 01:04:06.559
of nur but i assure you that i was

01:04:03.839 --> 01:04:08.960
talking to muhammad sallam why because

01:04:06.559 --> 01:04:10.960
there's a split in the same discourse

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:14.160
whenever there's a split in the same

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:16.160
discourse a new ayah continues a prior

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:18.720
discourse that means something changed

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:20.319
and we saw this in surah yusuf when

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:22.640
allah subhanahu wa ta'ala was teaching

01:04:20.319 --> 01:04:26.520
us about what yaakov said

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:26.520
first he said yeah

01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:42.400
it appears as if it's the same discourse

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:44.160
but in reality there's a shift

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:47.039
addressing muhammad sallallahu sallam

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:50.400
teaching him what to say this is part of

01:04:47.039 --> 01:04:53.760
the style of concealment that is used to

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:55.760
deliver wahi enjoyment to our beloved

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:57.839
sallallahu alaihi wasallam we will

01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:00.079
discuss a lot more examples like this in

01:04:57.839 --> 01:05:00.799
the future but for now let's continue

01:05:00.079 --> 01:05:02.359
with

01:05:00.799 --> 01:05:05.760
note number four

01:05:02.359 --> 01:05:05.760
allah teaches us

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:08.960
addressing

01:05:10.799 --> 01:05:16.400
he revealed to you or made accessible to

01:05:13.599 --> 01:05:18.720
you the knowledge of the scripture and

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:20.799
al-hikma the collection of evidences

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:23.839
being if you remember hikmah we

01:05:20.799 --> 01:05:23.839
discussed this before

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:28.640
he taught you

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:31.039
whatever you did not learn before

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:34.319
whatever you did not know before and

01:05:31.039 --> 01:05:38.319
therefore allah is clearly teaching us

01:05:34.319 --> 01:05:42.000
that adam was taught muhammad was taught

01:05:38.319 --> 01:05:42.000
in surah rahman the same thing

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:47.839
and i want to close this segment with

01:05:45.039 --> 01:05:50.480
something shocking something amazing i

01:05:47.839 --> 01:05:52.880
will enlarge it a little bit this is

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:55.520
from a hadith reported from the

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:58.400
collection of muslim i want to enlarge

01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:59.839
it as much as possible so you can see it

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:03.119
i'm not going to get into the whole

01:05:59.839 --> 01:06:05.920
hadith but i want you to focus on just a

01:06:03.119 --> 01:06:09.520
couple of aspects of it because it is

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:13.839
truly amazing now between parentheses

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:17.520
we do not accept hadith as authoritative

01:06:13.839 --> 01:06:20.799
to teach us something about the quran no

01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:23.599
we learn from the quran and then we see

01:06:20.799 --> 01:06:27.200
if there is a hadith that confirms some

01:06:23.599 --> 01:06:29.760
linguistic aspects that confirm what we

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:32.880
learn from the quran then we accept it

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:35.200
and we say that hadith is likely to be

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:38.079
correct not the other way around we

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:40.880
don't assume the hadith correct and then

01:06:38.079 --> 01:06:44.319
impose it over the quran so i'm using an

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:47.680
example of the hadith from the so-called

01:06:44.319 --> 01:06:50.559
muslim not to prove or not to accept

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:52.960
that all hadith are acceptable we don't

01:06:50.559 --> 01:06:56.240
undertake that position in this channel

01:06:52.960 --> 01:07:00.319
we're simply saying there is affirmation

01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:02.640
to everything we've said that muhammad

01:07:00.319 --> 01:07:04.920
and he learned their locution the

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:08.400
locution of the

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:10.799
allah taught him all of their locution

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:13.200
is there evidence from outside the quran

01:07:10.799 --> 01:07:14.480
yes it's not evidence it is a

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:17.119
confirmation

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:19.119
that we are on the correct track i want

01:07:17.119 --> 01:07:20.480
you to watch this hadith and learn from

01:07:19.119 --> 01:07:22.960
it we're not going to get into the whole

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:25.720
hadith the story of this hadith which is

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:28.400
reported by

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:31.440
saudi allah is one of the closest

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:34.400
companions of the prophet sallam who is

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:37.680
generally ignored by the tradition

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:39.359
he was the caretaker the server of our

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:42.160
beloved sallallahu assalam in the last

01:07:39.359 --> 01:07:44.400
few years of his life and we know very

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:47.200
little about him because we were not

01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:50.319
told much about him and yet he reported

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:52.960
or on his authority we received several

01:07:50.319 --> 01:07:54.880
narrations this is one of them reported

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:58.559
in sahih muslim

01:07:54.880 --> 01:08:01.920
so tawban is supposedly to have said i

01:07:58.559 --> 01:08:05.440
was present near muhammad sallam and

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:07.520
then one of their rabbis from the rabbis

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:09.760
of the jews came

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:12.640
and he said assalamu

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:15.200
muhammad and i pushed him i pushed that

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:17.759
rabbi a strong push

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:20.000
please learn

01:08:17.759 --> 01:08:23.040
he almost fainted because of it and the

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.640
rabbi said why do you push me and i said

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:28.000
meaning thou ban

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:31.759
replied why don't you say oh messenger

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:34.799
of allah pay attention what did they say

01:08:31.759 --> 01:08:34.799
to their messengers

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:38.799
this is how they address their

01:08:36.239 --> 01:08:38.799
messengers

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:56.080
his parents called him that name and

01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:57.600
therefore we use

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:59.759
that name and then the messenger

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:01.759
sallallahu sallam heard this

01:08:59.759 --> 01:09:04.799
and he replied in

01:09:01.759 --> 01:09:07.600
muhammad allah

01:09:04.799 --> 01:09:09.120
my name by which my parents call me is

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:11.600
muhammad

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:11.600
yahood

01:09:11.759 --> 01:09:18.000
i came to ask you or to interrogate you

01:09:15.839 --> 01:09:21.839
rasulullah

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.839
the messenger of allah said to him

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:32.839
please pay attention the rabbi came to

01:09:29.759 --> 01:09:34.960
the messenger sallam to ask him a few

01:09:32.839 --> 01:09:37.920
questions sallam

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:41.920
replied does it serve you

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:43.279
if i use hadith in replying to you in

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:46.400
haddath

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:49.120
very strange way of expressing the

01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:50.960
answers in other words he is using a

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:52.159
special code

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:53.440
i am

01:09:52.159 --> 01:09:55.760
in

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:58.239
ask any arabic speaker this is not how

01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:58.239
they speak

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:02.239
so what is muhammad our beloved

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:05.199
salallahu

01:10:02.239 --> 01:10:08.880
he's using the locution of the rabbi the

01:10:05.199 --> 01:10:08.880
answer by the rabbi is

01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:13.840
i listen with my two ears who speaks

01:10:12.719 --> 01:10:16.159
like this

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:18.960
these are code words these are the

01:10:16.159 --> 01:10:20.080
locution of

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:22.560
allah

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:22.560
taught us

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:26.920
that muhammad sallallahu asalla

01:10:30.239 --> 01:10:34.480
did not order us to learn it we are not

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:35.440
supposed to learn it we don't need to

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:37.600
learn it

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:40.480
we have the quran we have the divine

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:42.080
locution that is deposited in the final

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:45.040
scripture

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:47.120
this hadith continues it goes on back

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:49.280
and forth and i really don't care about

01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:51.600
all of the details of this information

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:53.679
giving back back and forth it's all full

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:57.600
of codes by the way and it doesn't

01:10:53.679 --> 01:10:59.360
really matter and then he continues

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:02.719
m okay

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:05.840
a second time our beloved sallam says

01:11:02.719 --> 01:11:08.080
does it help you if i use hadith to talk

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:10.239
to you hadith pay attention

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:12.400
why did they call the narrations by our

01:11:10.239 --> 01:11:15.199
beloved

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:18.400
because the jews before our beloved

01:11:15.199 --> 01:11:21.920
solar sallam referred to talmud as

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:24.320
hadith so the early generations decided

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:27.040
that we need a similar thing and they

01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:28.960
called it the same name hadith so our

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:31.520
beloved solar assalamu was using the

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:33.120
locution in their secret books the

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:36.560
talmud

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:39.360
and allah told us in the quran that

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:40.400
muhammad was taught that and here he was

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:42.480
using it

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:46.320
with this rabbi

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:46.320
this rabbi answered again

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:50.880
i listen with my own two ears

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:54.239
who speaks like this

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:56.560
this is the locution of al-baba again i

01:11:54.239 --> 01:11:59.360
really don't care about much of the

01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:01.920
semantics of what's in the hadith i care

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:04.239
about the linguistic evidence that

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:05.360
corroborates some of what we have

01:12:04.239 --> 01:12:08.480
discovered

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:12.480
in this ayat from surat al-baqarah ayah

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:15.040
232 and ayah 2 33 and with this we have

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:17.360
completed this segment and i ask allah

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:19.760
subhanahu wa'ta'ala that he taught us

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:22.400
something that we benefited from and

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:26.159
that you inshaallah will continue to

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:29.600
listen to future segments in this series

01:12:26.159 --> 01:12:32.159
part 8 and part 9 are coming sha allah

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:34.640
and i promise you they're absolutely

01:12:32.159 --> 01:12:36.880
mind-blowing i thank you very much for

01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:39.840
watching we will make that insha allah

01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:39.840
before we close

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:49.880
so
