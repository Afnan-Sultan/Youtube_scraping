# Youtube_scraping

This project is a personal project that I though to share because it took me a lot of time to gather these simple lines of code from a very scattered Q&A pages, tutorials and languages. 
It's not ready for direct use. So, You will need to have a knowledge of python beforhand, and to tailor the code to your specific channel/video. However, I hope I maded it as easy as possible by including detailed comments and links to refer to when needed.
