# Youtube_scraping

This project is a personal project that I thought to share because it took me a lot of time to gather these simple lines of code from a very scattered Q&A pages, tutorials and languages.   
It's not ready for direct use. So, You will need to have a knowledge of python beforhand, and to tailor the code to your specific channel,video, transcript language, output type ...etc. However, I hope I made it as easy as possible by including detailed comments and links to refer to when needed.  
I included the folder 'sample_output' to show you what to expect as an output.
